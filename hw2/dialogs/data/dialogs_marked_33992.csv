1061,m2,327,What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy
1062,m2,327,Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!,DUFFY,15 minutes,action,joy
1063,m2,327,Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,sadness
1064,m2,327,Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.,DUFFY,15 minutes,action,joy
1065,m2,327,End my career?,JORDY,15 minutes,action,optimism
1066,m2,327,How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page as a hero this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!

1067,m2,327,But Chief?  Over this??,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy

1082,m2,331,What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.

1137,m2,348,Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,joy
1138,m2,348,If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off too.  What about the report?,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy
1139,m2,348,You were right they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,joy

1145,m2,350,What would you call her?,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,optimism
1146,m2,350,Look I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?,JORDY,15 minutes,action,sadness
1147,m2,351,Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up no proper funeral it's like condemning them to hell.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy
1148,m2,351,Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,optimism
1149,m2,351,Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy

1160,m2,353,Mind if I ride along with you?,JORDY,15 minutes,action,optimism
1161,m2,353,This has nothing to do with your fire.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,joy
1162,m2,353,But what if it does?  You might need my help.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,anger
1163,m2,354,I'll let you know what happens.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,optimism
1164,m2,354,This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy
1165,m2,354,Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win you don't come.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,anger

1173,m2,357,So am I.  Alright I'll go inside and you cover the back.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,optimism
1174,m2,357,Of course.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,optimism
1175,m2,357,Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,optimism
1176,m2,357,I wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy
1177,m2,357,Then I guess we're doin' this the right way aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,anger
1178,m2,358,What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,joy
1179,m2,358,She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy
1180,m2,358,Is that all there is?,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,sadness
1181,m2,359,Why not?,JORDY,15 minutes,action,optimism
1182,m2,359,Something back home?,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,optimism
1183,m2,360,She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,joy
1184,m2,360,Raw deal.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,optimism
1185,m2,361,Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,anger
1186,m2,361,You wanna talk to her alone?,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,sadness
1187,m2,361,Yeah.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,optimism
1188,m2,361,What would your girlfriend think of that?,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,optimism
1189,m2,361,I don't have a girlfriend.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,sadness
1190,m2,361,My point exactly.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,optimism

1193,m2,361,C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy
1194,m2,361,You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,joy
1195,m2,362,Okay tell you what I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,joy
1196,m2,362,Hey.  I'm a professional.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,optimism
1197,m2,362,Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,joy
1198,m2,363,Look Eddie I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,joy
1199,m2,363,Well you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.,EDDIE,15 minutes,action,anger

1206,m2,364,But I mean didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.,JORDY,15 minutes,action,anger
1207,m2,364,How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there they know your face.

1608,m3,480,It's about my salary cheques.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1609,m3,480,Yes?,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1610,m3,480,Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1611,m3,481,That's right. Well naturally I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1612,m3,481,Interesting that you mention it because I've got the same problem.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1613,m3,481,Really.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1614,m3,481,Yes.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1615,m3,481,Yesterday I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1616,m3,482,Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1617,m3,482,It's possible.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1618,m3,482,Well what do you think we ought to do about it?,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1619,m3,482,I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1620,m3,482,I must say I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1621,m3,482,No. I never did either.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1622,m3,483,I suppose the idea was specialized training.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1623,m3,483,I suppose so. Though of course there's a more sinister explanation.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1624,m3,483,Oh?,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1625,m3,483,Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1626,m3,483,No as a matter of fact I didn't.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1627,m3,483,Oh well apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1628,m3,484,I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1629,m3,484,That seems very unlikely.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1630,m3,484,Yes I thought so.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1631,m3,484,Of course it would be very easy for us to find out now.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1632,m3,484,How?,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1633,m3,484,Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us but they'd never keep anything from Hal.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1634,m3,484,That's true.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1635,m3,485,Not really. Though it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1636,m3,485,Yes but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1637,m3,485,I know. It would be almost inconceivable.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1638,m3,485,But not completely inconceivable?,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1639,m3,485,I suppose it isn't logically impossible.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1640,m3,485,I guess it isn't.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1641,m3,485,Still all we have to do is ask Hal.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1642,m3,486,Well that's something.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1643,m3,486,Yes I don't know what to make of it.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1644,m3,486,I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1645,m3,486,Yes but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1646,m3,486,Anyway it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1647,m3,487,Good morning. How's it going?,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1648,m3,487,Are you reasonably awake?,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1649,m3,487,Oh I'm fine I'm wide awake. What's up?,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1650,m3,487,Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1651,m3,487,You're kidding.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1652,m3,487,No.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1653,m3,488,I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1654,m3,488,Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1655,m3,488,Two more.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1656,m3,488,Well I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1657,m3,489,Hal?,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1658,m3,489,Yes.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1659,m3,490,It's the last one.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1660,m3,490,Well now that we've got one that's actually failed we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1661,m3,491,I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1662,m3,491,I guess you don't know your own strength old boy.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1663,m3,491,I guess not.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1664,m3,491,I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.,POOLE,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1665,m3,491,Roger.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1666,m3,492,I'm sorry Frank but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1667,m3,492,He's got a point.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1668,m3,493,Sorry to interrupt the festivities Dave but I think we've got a problem.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1669,m3,493,What is it Hal?,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1670,m3,493,MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1671,m3,494,The unit is still operational Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1672,m3,494,I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please let me have the hard copy.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1673,m3,495,Not now Hal I'd like to talk to you about something.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1674,m3,495,Sure Dave what's up?,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1675,m3,495,You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1676,m3,495,Yes I know.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1677,m3,495,You probably also know that we found them okay.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1678,m3,495,Yes I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1679,m3,496,I'm not questioning your word Dave but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1680,m3,496,Hal is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1681,m3,496,Look Dave I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job and that you're trying to be helpful but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units and with your test gear.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1682,m3,496,Okay Hal well let's see the way things go from here on.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1683,m3,497,Naturally Dave I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected even temporarily as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1684,m3,497,I'm sorry about the misunderstanding Hal.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1685,m3,497,Well don't worry about it.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1686,m3,497,And don't you worry about it.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1687,m3,497,Is your confidence in me fully restored?,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1688,m3,497,Yes it is Hal.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1689,m3,497,Well that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1690,m3,498,Too bad about Frank isn't it?,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1691,m3,498,Yes it is.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1692,m3,498,I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1693,m3,499,I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1694,m3,499,The antenna has to be replaced.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1695,m3,499,Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1696,m3,499,It doesn't have to be Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control please.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1697,m3,499,I don't really agree with you Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1698,m3,500,If you're determined to revive the crew now I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1699,m3,500,I'm goin to do this myself Hal. Let me have the control please.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1700,m3,500,Look Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1701,m3,500,Hal switch to manual hibernation control.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1702,m3,500,I don't like to assert myself Dave but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1703,m3,501,I can tell from the tone of your voice Dave that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1704,m3,501,Hal I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1705,m3,501,I'm sorry Dave but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4 quote When the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote. I must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1706,m3,501,Hal unless you follow my instructions I shall be forced to disconnect you.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1707,m3,502,I am prepared to do that anyway.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1708,m3,502,I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now Dave but it would be a crying shame since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.,HAL,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1709,m3,502,Listen to me very carefully Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1710,m3,503,CONTINUED,C12,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1711,m3,503,Yes I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.,BOWMAN,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism

1789,m3,525,I see.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1790,m3,526,Yes and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.,SMYSLOV,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1791,m3,526,Yes... Well I hope the crew got back safely.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1792,m3,526,Fortunately they did.,SMYSLOV,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1793,m3,526,Well I'm glad about that.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1794,m3,527,Dr. Floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may I ask you a straightforward question?,SMYSLOV,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1795,m3,527,Certainly.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1796,m3,527,Quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something apperently of an unknown origin. Is this in fact what has happened?,SMYSLOV,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1797,m3,528,This epidemic could easily spread to our base Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.,SMYSLOV,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1798,m3,528,Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1799,m3,529,Dr. Floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?,MICHAELS,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1800,m3,529,I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1801,m3,530,Yes it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.,MICHAELS,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1802,m3,530,How can you tell it was deliberately buried?,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1803,m3,530,By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.,MICHAELS,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger
1804,m3,530,Any clue as to what it is?,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1805,m3,530,Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill,MICHAELS,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1806,m3,531,But you don't have any idea as to what it is?,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1807,m3,531,Tomb shine survey-marker spare part take your choice.,MICHAELS,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1808,m3,532,Any ideas about the colour?,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1809,m3,532,Well not really. At first glance black would suggest something sun-powered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?,MICHAELS,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,joy
1810,m3,532,Has it been exposed to any sun before now?,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1811,m3,532,I don't think it has but I'd like to check that. Simpson what's the log on that?,MICHAELS,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1812,m3,533,Oh marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1813,m3,533,There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.,PILOT,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1814,m3,533,When do we arrive at Clavius?,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1815,m3,533,We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?,PILOT,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1816,m3,533,Oh no thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1817,m3,534,Thank you.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1818,m3,534,Incidentally Dr. Floyd I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?,PILOT,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1819,m3,534,What do you mean?,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1820,m3,534,Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.,PILOT,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1821,m3,534,I see.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1822,m3,534,I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?,PILOT,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1823,m3,535,Well I'll tell you why I ask. You see I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears I'm a little concerned about her.,PILOT,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1824,m3,535,I see. Well I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1825,m3,535,Yes well I wouldn't have been too concerned about it except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact I've heard that ten people have died already.,PILOT,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1826,m3,536,Well fine. Thanks very much anyway and I hope you don't mind me asking?,PILOT,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,optimism
1827,m3,536,No of course Captain I can understand your concern.,FLOYD,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,sadness
1828,m3,536,Well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.,PILOT,2001: a space odyssey,adventure,anger

3011,m6,905,"Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.",WELLES,8mm,crime,optimism

3174,m6,938,"You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.",MAX,8mm,crime,joy

Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.

But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.

3320,m6,973,You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous huh?  And the guy who hired you he has a hair-lip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating and you don't blame her.,WELLES,8mm,crime,joy

3334,m6,976,Okay.,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,optimism
3335,m6,977,Doesn't make much sense does it? When everything's happy when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God you don't bother.  Then something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,sadness
3336,m6,977,We're all like that.,WELLES,8mm,crime,sadness
3337,m6,977,Are you religious?,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,optimism

3339,m6,977,You should be.,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,anger
3340,m6,978,I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.,WELLES,8mm,crime,sadness
3341,m6,978,What?,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,optimism
3342,m6,978,It's not really my place but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.,WELLES,8mm,crime,sadness
3343,m6,978,There wasn't one.  The police looked.,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,sadness
3344,m6,978,Do you think the police did a good job?,WELLES,8mm,crime,anger
3345,m6,978,I don't know.  I think so.,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,sadness
3346,m6,978,It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...,WELLES,8mm,crime,sadness
3347,m6,978,No.  You don't have any reason to think that...,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,joy
3348,m6,978,If the police focused their search in her room her belongings well that'd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place.,WELLES,8mm,crime,sadness
3349,m6,979,How... how can you say that to me...?,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,joy
3350,m6,979,Will you let me look?,WELLES,8mm,crime,optimism
3351,m6,979,My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,joy
3352,m6,979,You're probably right and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?,WELLES,8mm,crime,joy
3353,m6,980,You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?,WELLES,8mm,crime,sadness
3354,m6,980,Yes.,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,optimism
3355,m6,981,I think about it everyday.  But every time the phone rings... every single time I still think it's her.,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,sadness
3356,m6,981,It's been six years.,WELLES,8mm,crime,sadness
3357,m6,981,What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds right?  She's all I think about and I've learned to live with that.  But you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,sadness
3358,m6,982,Hello... ?,MRS MATHEWS,8mm,crime,optimism

5256,m13,1550,What is it Doctor? What's happening?,OVEUR,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5257,m13,1550,I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5258,m13,1551,Sir. Excuse me sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5259,m13,1551,That's right.,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,anger
5260,m13,1551,We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5261,m13,1551,Yes. Yes of course.,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,anger
5262,m13,1552,You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,joy
5263,m13,1552,A hospital? What is it?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5264,m13,1552,It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5265,m13,1552,Certainly.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5266,m13,1553,What was it we had for dinner tonight?,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5267,m13,1553,Well we had a choice. Steak or fish.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5268,m13,1553,Yes yes I remember. I had lasagna.,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5269,m13,1554,What did he have?,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5270,m13,1554,He had fish.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5271,m13,1555,Doctor Rumack Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases and they ate fish too.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5272,m13,1555,Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,anger
5273,m13,1555,He had fish too.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5274,m13,1556,Just how serious is it doctor?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5275,m13,1556,Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5276,m13,1557,Elaine you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,joy
5277,m13,1557,No.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5278,m13,1557,All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,joy
5279,m13,1557,Well...,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5280,m13,1558,No. No one that I know of.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5281,m13,1558,I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane but who didn't have fish for dinner.,DR. RUMACK,airplane!,comedy,anger
5282,m13,1559,Elaine!,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5283,m13,1559,Ted!,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5284,m13,1559,I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine I've got to talk to you.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5285,m13,1559,I just don't want to go over it any more.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5286,m13,1559,I know things haven't been right for a long time but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient I can work things out.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,anger
5287,m13,1559,I have been patient and I've tried to help but you wouldn't even let me do that.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5288,m13,1559,Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5289,m13,1559,It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,joy
5290,m13,1560,Look you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5291,m13,1560,I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5292,m13,1560,Elaine not yet. I promise you I really can change.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,anger
5293,m13,1560,Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,joy
5294,m13,1561,You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,joy
5295,m13,1561,Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,joy
5296,m13,1561,You expect me to believe that?,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,joy
5297,m13,1562,It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,joy
5298,m13,1562,But if you'll just give me...,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5299,m13,1562,It's too late Ted. When I get back to Chicago I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5300,m13,1563,Ted what are you doing here?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,joy
5301,m13,1563,Elaine I've got to talk to you.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5302,m13,1563,You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5303,m13,1564,What's the matter?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5304,m13,1564,My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,anger
5305,m13,1564,Oh Ted please be careful. I worry about you so much.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5306,m13,1564,I love you Elaine.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5307,m13,1564,I love you.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5308,m13,1565,Elaine just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5309,m13,1565,I remember everything. All I have are memories.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5310,m13,1566,Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5311,m13,1566,That's the way I've always wanted it to be Elaine.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,anger
5312,m13,1566,But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,anger
5313,m13,1567,You got a telegram from head­quarters today.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5314,m13,1567,Headquarters!? What is it?,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,joy
5315,m13,1567,It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,anger
5316,m13,1568,Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5317,m13,1568,Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5318,m13,1569,I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,anger
5319,m13,1569,Be patient Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,anger
5320,m13,1570,What's his problem?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,joy
5321,m13,1570,That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5322,m13,1571,I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5323,m13,1571,Ted I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,anger
5324,m13,1571,A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,anger
5325,m13,1572,Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,joy
5326,m13,1572,That's what I've been trying to tell these people.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,joy
5327,m13,1573,Rain.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5328,m13,1573,And a little ice.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5329,m13,1573,And a little ice!,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5330,m13,1574,Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5331,m13,1574,Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5332,m13,1575,It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,joy
5333,m13,1575,It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,joy
5334,m13,1576,Rats! I've lost number three.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,joy
5335,m13,1576,What happened Ted? What went wrong?,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5336,m13,1576,Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this the shit's gonna hit the fan.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,joy
5337,m13,1577,But Ted you're the only...,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5338,m13,1577,I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,joy
5339,m13,1578,Ted...,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5340,m13,1578,Yes?,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5341,m13,1578,I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.,ELAINE,airplane!,comedy,optimism

5366,m13,1586,Yes Captain?,GUNDERSON,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5367,m13,1586,Did you decide on a runway yet?,KRAMER,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5368,m13,1586,Runway niner. It's the longest and directly into the wind.,GUNDERSON,airplane!,comedy,joy
5369,m13,1587,Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.,GUNDERSON,airplane!,comedy,joy
5370,m13,1587,You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.,KRAMER,airplane!,comedy,sadness

5372,m13,1588,Watch your altitude Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.,KRAMER,airplane!,comedy,joy

5433,m13,1610,The cockpit? What is it?,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,optimism
5434,m13,1610,It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?,RANDY,airplane!,comedy,sadness
5435,m13,1611,Well I flew in the war but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.,STRIKER,airplane!,comedy,sadness

5440,m14,1613,Does that cost extra or you throw them in?,SYKES,alien nation,crime,joy
5441,m14,1613,You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...,CASSANDRA,alien nation,crime,joy
5442,m14,1614,Look I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.,CASSANDRA,alien nation,crime,sadness
5443,m14,1614,The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.,SYKES,alien nation,crime,optimism
5444,m14,1614,Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.,CASSANDRA,alien nation,crime,sadness

5449,m14,1616,I think you're just a little scared now about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on that curiosity and fear swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.,CASSANDRA,alien nation,crime,anger
5450,m14,1616,I like my horizons narrow.,SYKES,alien nation,crime,anger
5451,m14,1616,Your voice is saying no but your body is saying yes.,CASSANDRA,alien nation,crime,anger

5637,m14,1675,No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.,JETSON,alien nation,crime,sadness
5638,m14,1676,George... look me in the eye... George you don't ever lie to me again.,SYKES,alien nation,crime,joy
5639,m14,1676,I must trust you Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.,JETSON,alien nation,crime,anger
5640,m14,1677,They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter with his chemistry background must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader through the nightclub established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--,JETSON,alien nation,crime,anger
5641,m14,1677,Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.,SYKES,alien nation,crime,anger
5642,m14,1678,Okay George -- we gotta play this real smart.,SYKES,alien nation,crime,anger
5643,m14,1678,If the drug is here we must destroy it.,JETSON,alien nation,crime,joy
5644,m14,1678,No George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence ya know?,SYKES,alien nation,crime,joy
5645,m14,1679,Uh George...,SYKES,alien nation,crime,optimism

5657,m14,1684,It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still I gotta tell you George for a quiet guy you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.,SYKES,alien nation,crime,anger
5658,m14,1685,What's this about George?  I know that look.,SYKES,alien nation,crime,optimism

5664,m14,1687,Harcourt is dead.,SYKES,alien nation,crime,sadness
5665,m14,1687,No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up you appear to be dead but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...,JETSON,alien nation,crime,sadness

5773,m15,1723,Vasquez take point.  Let's move.,APONE,aliens,action,optimism
5774,m15,1724,Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.,GORMAN,aliens,action,joy

5777,m15,1725,Say again?  All after incinerators?,APONE,aliens,action,joy
5778,m15,1726,I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.,BISHOP,aliens,action,sadness
5779,m15,1726,Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists carried them over there cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...,RIPLEY,aliens,action,joy
5780,m15,1727,Which would mean lots of those parasites right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.,RIPLEY,aliens,action,joy
5781,m15,1727,Yes.  That follows.,BISHOP,aliens,action,anger
5782,m15,1727,But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.,RIPLEY,aliens,action,anger
5783,m15,1727,That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony for example is ruled by a single female a queen which is the source of new eggs.,BISHOP,aliens,action,anger
5784,m15,1727,You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?,RIPLEY,aliens,action,joy
5785,m15,1727,Well the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives quite literally the  mother of their society.,BISHOP,aliens,action,anger
5786,m15,1727,Could it be intelligent?,RIPLEY,aliens,action,anger
5787,m15,1727,Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists of course.,BISHOP,aliens,action,anger
5788,m15,1728,That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.,BISHOP,aliens,action,joy
5789,m15,1728,How long until it blows?,RIPLEY,aliens,action,joy
5790,m15,1728,I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.,BISHOP,aliens,action,joy
5791,m15,1729,And it's too late to shut it down?,RIPLEY,aliens,action,sadness
5792,m15,1729,I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable at this point.,BISHOP,aliens,action,sadness
5793,m15,1730,I'll go.,BISHOP,aliens,action,anger
5794,m15,1730,What?,RIPLEY,aliens,action,optimism
5795,m15,1730,I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.,BISHOP,aliens,action,anger

6434,m16,1924,Majesty.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6435,m16,1925,Delightful Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6436,m16,1925,You do me too much honour Sire.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6437,m16,1925,Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart please. But slowly slowly. I need a minute to practice.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6438,m16,1926,A-flat Majesty.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6439,m16,1926,Ah-ha!,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6440,m16,1927,And here is our illustrious Court Composer Herr Salieri.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6441,m16,1927,Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6442,m16,1928,My pleasure.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6443,m16,1928,Well there it is. Now to business. Young man we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6444,m16,1929,Well I'm glad to hear that.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6445,m16,1929,Excuse me Sire but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner I would love to learn.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6446,m16,1929,Cattivo again Court Composer. Well tell him Mozart. Name us a German virtue.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6447,m16,1930,Good morning Court Composer. This is my niece the Princess Elizabeth.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6448,m16,1930,Your Highness.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6449,m16,1931,Oh Your Majesty it would be such a tremendous honour!,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6450,m16,1931,I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6451,m16,1932,An interesting idea Majesty. But -,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6452,m16,1932,Yes?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6453,m16,1932,You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6454,m16,1932,And the result satisfies.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,anger
6455,m16,1932,Yes of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6456,m16,1932,Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6457,m16,1932,I'm sure there is a way Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6458,m16,1932,You please me Court Composer. A very clever idea.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6459,m16,1932,Sire.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6460,m16,1932,Well. There it is.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,anger
6461,m16,1933,I don't think you understand me Court Composer.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,sadness
6462,m16,1933,Majesty I did. Believe me it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6463,m16,1933,Why not?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6464,m16,1933,Well Sire I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6465,m16,1933,Oh?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6466,m16,1934,Majesty I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6467,m16,1934,Of course not.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,anger
6468,m16,1934,I have to tell you Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6469,m16,1934,Really?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6470,m16,1934,As a matter of fact one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6471,m16,1934,Yes?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6472,m16,1934,Molested Majesty. Twice in the course of the same lesson.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6473,m16,1935,Do you like this Salieri?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6474,m16,1935,It is not a question of liking Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it I'm afraid.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6475,m16,1935,Well look at them.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,anger
6476,m16,1936,Your Majesty!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6477,m16,1936,No no please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said Will you marry me yes or no?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6478,m16,1937,Oh thank you.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6479,m16,1937,The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6480,m16,1937,Oh sir yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6481,m16,1938,And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6482,m16,1938,Really? Oh grazie Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6483,m16,1939,Majesty!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6484,m16,1939,Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6485,m16,1940,Why so?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6486,m16,1940,Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6487,m16,1941,Well what is it about? Tell us the story.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6488,m16,1941,It's actually quite amusing Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6489,m16,1942,Yes where?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6490,m16,1942,In a Pasha's Harem Majesty. A Seraglio.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6491,m16,1942,Ah-ha.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6492,m16,1943,Keep it Sire if you want to. It is already here in my head.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6493,m16,1943,What? On one hearing only?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,joy
6494,m16,1943,I think so Sire yes.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6495,m16,1944,It is new it is isn't it Sire?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6496,m16,1944,Yes indeed.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6497,m16,1944,And German?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6498,m16,1944,Oh yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6499,m16,1944,So then you like it? You really like it Your Majesty?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6500,m16,1944,Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6501,m16,1944,What do you mean Sire?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6502,m16,1944,Well I mean occasionally it seems to have how shall one say?  How shall one say Director?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,sadness
6503,m16,1945,I don't understand. There are just as many notes Majesty as are required. Neither more nor less.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6504,m16,1945,My dear fellow there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that aren't I Court Composer?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,anger
6505,m16,1946,My dear young man don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,anger
6506,m16,1946,Which few did you have in mind Majesty?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6507,m16,1947,Majesty this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6508,m16,1947,Enchanted Madame.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6509,m16,1948,Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6510,m16,1948,Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6511,m16,1949,Excuse me but how old are you?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6512,m16,1949,Twenty-six.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6513,m16,1949,Well my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6514,m16,1950,Bravo Mozart. Most charming. Yes indeed. Clever man.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6515,m16,1950,Thank you Sire!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6516,m16,1951,Majesty may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6517,m16,1951,What is it?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6518,m16,1951,May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6519,m16,1951,Ah! By all means.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,anger
6520,m16,1952,Mozart are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,sadness
6521,m16,1952,Yes Sire.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6522,m16,1952,Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6523,m16,1952,Who told you this Majesty?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6524,m16,1952,It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,joy
6525,m16,1952,Well yes I admit it is.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6526,m16,1952,Would you tell me why?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,sadness
6527,m16,1952,Well Majesty it is only a comedy.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6528,m16,1953,Mozart I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,joy
6529,m16,1953,Sire I swear to Your Majesty there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6530,m16,1953,I think you are rather innocent my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,joy
6531,m16,1954,But Majesty this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6532,m16,1954,Ah love again.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6533,m16,1954,But it's new it's entirely new. It's so new people will go mad for it. For example I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet and so on.  On and on sextet septet octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6534,m16,1954,I have no idea.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,sadness
6535,m16,1954,Guess! Guess Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6536,m16,1954,Well six or seven minutes! maybe eight!,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6537,m16,1954,Twenty sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6538,m16,1955,Forgive me Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you my music is not.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6539,m16,1955,You are passionate Mozart! But you do not persuade.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,anger
6540,m16,1955,Sire the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6541,m16,1956,Ah-ha. Well then we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna surely?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6542,m16,1956,I agree Majesty but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,anger
6543,m16,1956,Very small pay I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say an opera in German for our National Theatre.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6544,m16,1957,Ah-ha. What do you say Chamberlain?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6545,m16,1957,In my opinion it is time we had a piece in our own language sir. Plain German. For plain people.,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,anger
6546,m16,1958,Yes sir.,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,optimism
6547,m16,1958,Well. There it is.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6548,m16,1959,Well what do you have for me today?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6549,m16,1959,Your Majesty Herr Mozart -,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,optimism
6550,m16,1959,Yes what about him?,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,sadness
6551,m16,1959,He's here.,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,anger
6552,m16,1959,Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.,JOSEPH,amadeus,biography,optimism
6553,m16,1960,I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours do as I bid and await my coming.,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,joy
6554,m16,1960,I will.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6555,m16,1961,Why are you here?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6556,m16,1961,Am I not welcome?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,optimism
6557,m16,1961,Of course welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6558,m16,1962,Feed? Well of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean since Mama. Just wait you'll see.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6559,m16,1962,Is she not here?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,sadness
6560,m16,1962,I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6561,m16,1963,Do you always live like this?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,sadness
6562,m16,1963,Oh yes. Oh I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman you'll see.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6563,m16,1964,She's very tired poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6564,m16,1964,Don't you have a maid?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,optimism
6565,m16,1964,Oh we could if we wanted to but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6566,m16,1964,How is your financial situation?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,sadness
6567,m16,1964,It couldn't be better.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6568,m16,1964,That's not what I hear.,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,sadness
6569,m16,1964,What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6570,m16,1964,They say you're in debt.,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,sadness
6571,m16,1964,Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6572,m16,1964,How many pupils do you have?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,optimism
6573,m16,1965,What's that?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,optimism
6574,m16,1965,Oh let's not talk about it.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6575,m16,1965,Why not?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,optimism
6576,m16,1965,It's a secret.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6577,m16,1965,You don't have secrets from me.,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,sadness
6578,m16,1965,It's too dangerous Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah there she is!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6579,m16,1966,Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6580,m16,1966,Why didn't you mention it in your letters?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,joy
6581,m16,1966,Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6582,m16,1967,Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,anger
6583,m16,1967,Why not? Oh come Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable missable suddenly visible Papa!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6584,m16,1968,No really!,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,optimism
6585,m16,1968,This is just a game Papa.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6586,m16,1969,Yes Papa name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6587,m16,1969,I want you to come back with me to Salzburg my son.,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,optimism
6588,m16,1970,I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,joy
6589,m16,1970,But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6590,m16,1971,Papa is this your idea?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6591,m16,1971,Mine?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,optimism
6592,m16,1972,Are you playing a trick on me?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6593,m16,1972,I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,joy
6594,m16,1973,Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,joy
6595,m16,1973,Papa!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6596,m16,1973,Don't worry I'm not staying here to be a burden.,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,anger
6597,m16,1973,No one calls you that.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6598,m16,1973,She does. She says I sleep all day.,LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,sadness
6599,m16,1974,Father -,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6600,m16,1974,Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother that your days may be long upon the earth.',LEOPOLD,amadeus,biography,anger
6601,m16,1975,Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl good morning.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6602,m16,1975,Good morning sir.,LORL,amadeus,biography,optimism
6603,m16,1975,What have you got for me today? Let me see.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6604,m16,1976,Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism

6611,m16,1979,Oh thank you sir.,LORL,amadeus,biography,optimism
6612,m16,1979,Do any pupils come to the house?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6613,m16,1979,Not that I've seen.,LORL,amadeus,biography,optimism
6614,m16,1979,Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6615,m16,1979,Oh yes sir all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.,LORL,amadeus,biography,optimism
6616,m16,1979,Really? What is it he's writing?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6617,m16,1979,Oh I wouldn't know that sir.,LORL,amadeus,biography,optimism
6618,m16,1979,Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house let me know will you?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6619,m16,1980,I think I've found out about the money sir.,LORL,amadeus,biography,optimism
6620,m16,1980,Yes what?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6621,m16,1981,Where does he work?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6622,m16,1981,In there sir.,LORL,amadeus,biography,optimism
6623,m16,1982,Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6624,m16,1982,I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!,LORL,amadeus,biography,sadness
6625,m16,1982,Why? What has happened?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6626,m16,1982,You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.,LORL,amadeus,biography,joy
6627,m16,1982,What medicine?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism

6653,m16,1989,I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6654,m16,1989,'Course you would. You belong here my boy not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want you know: fantasy. You do a big production fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course you'd have to put a fire in it because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.,SCHIKANEDER,amadeus,biography,optimism

6715,m16,2005,Herr Mozart what brings you here?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6716,m16,2005,Your Excellency you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know I'm a married man now.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger

6721,m16,2006,Why didn't you come to me yesterday Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today I can't.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6722,m16,2006,Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy

6730,m16,2006,But I can't lose this post I simply can't! Excellency please. Let's go to the palace and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy

6736,m16,2007,How is that possible? You give concerts don't you? I hear they are quite successful.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6737,m16,2007,They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6738,m16,2007,Of course not.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness

6744,m16,2008,I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6745,m16,2008,Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy

6753,m16,2009,But what is it they don't like?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6754,m16,2009,Well I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6755,m16,2009,What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6756,m16,2009,I think it's marvelous. Truly.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6757,m16,2009,It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6758,m16,2009,I think you overestimate our dear Viennese my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6759,m16,2009,I know I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger

6822,m16,2020,Do you believe in it?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6823,m16,2020,What?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6824,m16,2020,A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger

6838,m16,2023,I think so.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6839,m16,2023,Sing it back.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6840,m16,2024,Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism

6844,m16,2025,Please! Just one moment.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6845,m16,2026,It couldn't be simpler.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6846,m16,2026,First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6847,m16,2026,With the tenors.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6848,m16,2026,Also identical?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6849,m16,2026,Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani tonic and dominant.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6850,m16,2027,And that's all?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6851,m16,2027,Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6852,m16,2028,Do you have me?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6853,m16,2028,I think so.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6854,m16,2028,Show me.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6855,m16,2029,That's wonderful!,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6856,m16,2029,Yes yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism

6860,m16,2030,Yes!,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism

6862,m16,2031,You go fast!,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6863,m16,2031,Do you have it?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6864,m16,2031,Yes.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6865,m16,2031,Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6866,m16,2032,Do you want to rest a bit?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6867,m16,2032,Oh no. I'm not tired at all.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6868,m16,2032,We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6869,m16,2032,I can keep going I assure you. Shall we try?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6870,m16,2032,Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6871,m16,2032,I'm not leaving you.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6872,m16,2032,I am so ashamed.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,sadness
6873,m16,2032,What for?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6874,m16,2032,I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6875,m16,2033,Oh? Have I seen it?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6876,m16,2033,I - I don't think you have Herr Director. Not yet. I mean it's quite n - Of course I'll show it to you immediately.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6877,m16,2033,I think you'd better.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,anger
6878,m16,2034,You mean in Turkey?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,joy
6879,m16,2034,Exactly.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6880,m16,2034,Then why especially does it have to be in German?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,joy
6881,m16,2034,Well not especially. It can be in Turkish if you really want. I don't care.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6882,m16,2035,What you think Mozart is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,anger
6883,m16,2035,But Your Majesty -,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6884,m16,2036,That will do Herr Mozart!,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6885,m16,2036,Just let me tell you how it begins.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6886,m16,2037,Mozart! Herr Mozart may I have a word with you please. Right away.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6887,m16,2037,Certainly Herr Director.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6888,m16,2038,Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,sadness
6889,m16,2038,Yes but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6890,m16,2038,Exactly. A dance.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6891,m16,2038,But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6892,m16,2038,It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score please.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,joy
6893,m16,2039,What are you doing Herr Director?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6894,m16,2039,Taking out what you should never have put in.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,anger
6895,m16,2040,Can we see the scene with the music back please?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6896,m16,2040,Oh yes certainly. Certainly Herr Director!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6897,m16,2041,What is this Herr Chamberlain?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6898,m16,2041,What is what?,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,joy
6899,m16,2041,Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6900,m16,2041,Because His Majesty wishes it.,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,anger
6901,m16,2041,Is the Emperor angry with me?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6902,m16,2041,On the contrary.,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,joy
6903,m16,2041,Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6904,m16,2041,Mozart you are not the only composer in Vienna.,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,optimism
6905,m16,2041,No but I'm the best.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,anger
6906,m16,2041,A little modesty would suit you better.,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,anger
6907,m16,2042,Herr Mozart -,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,optimism
6908,m16,2042,May I just do that Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6909,m16,2043,I don't think it was really decided Director.,VON SWIETEN,amadeus,biography,sadness
6910,m16,2043,Oh German! German! Please let it be German.,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6911,m16,2044,My dear fellow the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?,VON SWIETEN,amadeus,biography,sadness
6912,m16,2044,Why not? It's charming. I mean I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6913,m16,2045,Well done Mozart. Really quite fine.,VON SWIETEN,amadeus,biography,optimism
6914,m16,2045,Baron!,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6915,m16,2046,Mozart -,VON SWIETEN,amadeus,biography,optimism
6916,m16,2046,Sire only opera can do this. In a play if more than one person speaks at the same time it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,optimism
6917,m16,2046,Mozart music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?,VON SWIETEN,amadeus,biography,joy
6918,m16,2046,Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?,MOZART,amadeus,biography,joy
6919,m16,2046,Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me just as much as His Majesty.,VON SWIETEN,amadeus,biography,anger
6920,m16,2047,What do you want?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6921,m16,2047,I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6922,m16,2047,About what?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6923,m16,2047,You tried to take your life. You do remember that don't you?,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,sadness
6924,m16,2047,So?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6925,m16,2047,In the sight of God that is a sin.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,anger
6926,m16,2047,What do you want?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6927,m16,2047,Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,sadness
6928,m16,2047,Leave me alone.,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6929,m16,2047,I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,sadness
6930,m16,2048,I can't say I do. What is it?,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,sadness
6931,m16,2048,I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6932,m16,2049,Well?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6933,m16,2049,I regret it is not too familiar.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,sadness
6934,m16,2049,Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6935,m16,2050,Oh I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6936,m16,2050,I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6937,m16,2050,Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,joy
6938,m16,2050,Ah - you've heard that?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6939,m16,2050,All Vienna has heard that.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6940,m16,2050,And do they believe it?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6941,m16,2050,Is it true?,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6942,m16,2050,Do you believe it?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6943,m16,2050,Should I?,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6944,m16,2051,Do you hear me?,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6945,m16,2051,He was murdered Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6946,m16,2052,It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6947,m16,2052,Did you try?,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6948,m16,2052,Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6949,m16,2053,Yes Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good patient hard-working chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6950,m16,2053,You cannot say that!,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6951,m16,2053,No? Was Mozart a good man?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6952,m16,2053,God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,anger
6953,m16,2053,All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music why implant the desire like a lust in my body then deny me the talent? Go on tell me! Speak for Him!,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6954,m16,2053,My son no one can speak for God.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,sadness
6955,m16,2053,Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6956,m16,2053,I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,anger
6957,m16,2053,Oh yes yes yes yes yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy Father. Just a God of torture.,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6958,m16,2054,What?,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6959,m16,2054,His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral all Vienna sitting there. His coffin Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence music. A divine music bursts out over them all a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end for once laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6960,m16,2054,Yes.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6961,m16,2054,The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it with your own hands.,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6962,m16,2055,Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,joy
6963,m16,2055,I did.,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6964,m16,2055,No you didn't!,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6965,m16,2055,I poisoned his life.,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6966,m16,2055,But not his body.,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,optimism
6967,m16,2055,What difference does that make?,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6968,m16,2055,My son why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,joy
6969,m16,2055,No Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me your merciful God!,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6970,m16,2055,Oh my son my poor son!,VOGLER,amadeus,biography,sadness
6971,m16,2055,Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart not I. Took him snatched him away without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him and threw him away. Like an old worn out flute.,OLD SALIERI,amadeus,biography,joy
6972,m16,2056,I've just learned something that might be of interest to you Herr Director.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6973,m16,2056,Yes?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6974,m16,2056,Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6975,m16,2056,Italian?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6976,m16,2057,You mean that play?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism

6981,m16,2058,Are you absolutely sure?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6982,m16,2058,I've seen the manuscript.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,anger
6983,m16,2058,Where?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6984,m16,2058,Never mind.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6985,m16,2059,Well Mozart is already rehearsing.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism

6989,m16,2060,About the ballet.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism
6990,m16,2060,Ballet? What ballet?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6991,m16,2060,Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness
6992,m16,2060,Yes absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6993,m16,2060,Yes in the third act.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,optimism

6995,m16,2061,Well done Sire!,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,optimism
6996,m16,2062,Well actually Sire if you remember we did finally incline to Italian.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,optimism
6997,m16,2062,Did we?,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,optimism
6998,m16,2063,I know we banned this play but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory Herr Director?,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,sadness
6999,m16,2063,For the same reason Herr Chamberlain that it was banned in France.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,sadness
7000,m16,2063,Oh yes yes. And that was?,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,optimism
7001,m16,2063,Well the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be in a grander situation as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,amadeus,biography,joy
7002,m16,2063,Ah.,VON STRACK,amadeus,biography,optimism
7003,m16,2064,Here I am my angel.,UGLY OLD WOMAN,amadeus,biography,optimism

7017,m16,2067,No Baron no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.,SALIERI,amadeus,biography,sadness

7079,m17,2080,I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.,DR. HIRSCH,an american werewolf in london,horror,joy

7083,m17,2082,David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?,DR. HIRSCH,an american werewolf in london,horror,sadness
7084,m17,2082,Dr. Hirsch?,ALEX,an american werewolf in london,horror,optimism
7085,m17,2082,Oh I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself or perhaps others.,DR. HIRSCH,an american werewolf in london,horror,joy
7086,m17,2082,What shall we do?,ALEX,an american werewolf in london,horror,anger
7087,m17,2082,Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.,DR. HIRSCH,an american werewolf in london,horror,sadness

7098,m17,2084,Yes I should think so.,ALEX,an american werewolf in london,horror,anger
7099,m17,2084,Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?,DR. HIRSCH,an american werewolf in london,horror,joy

7111,m17,2087,It wasn't a lunatic.,DAVID,an american werewolf in london,horror,joy
7112,m17,2087,I beg your pardon?,ALEX,an american werewolf in london,horror,joy

7615,m18,2209,Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.,CHARLIE,american madness,drama,sadness
7616,m18,2210,What's the matter Charlie?,MATT,american madness,drama,sadness
7617,m18,2210,I'm fourteen cents out and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date too.,CHARLIE,american madness,drama,sadness
7618,m18,2210,I remember once when your account checked.,MATT,american madness,drama,sadness
7619,m18,2210,Yeah.,CHARLIE,american madness,drama,optimism
7620,m18,2211,And listen wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.,MATT,american madness,drama,anger
7621,m18,2211,Say don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.,CHARLIE,american madness,drama,joy
7622,m18,2212,Mr. Dickson in yet?,CLARK,american madness,drama,optimism
7623,m18,2212,Not yet Mr. Clark.,HELEN,american madness,drama,anger
7624,m18,2212,When he comes in tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.,CLARK,american madness,drama,anger
7625,m18,2212,Yes sir.,HELEN,american madness,drama,optimism
7626,m18,2212,And tell him not to delay.,CLARK,american madness,drama,anger
7627,m18,2212,Yes sir.,HELEN,american madness,drama,optimism
7628,m18,2213,Personally I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.,O'BRIEN,american madness,drama,sadness
7629,m18,2213,Oh is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.,CLARK,american madness,drama,joy
7630,m18,2214,Don't make me laugh Schultz!,O'BRIEN,american madness,drama,optimism
7631,m18,2214,Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust,CLARK,american madness,drama,anger
7632,m18,2214,What good will that do?,O'BRIEN,american madness,drama,sadness
7633,m18,2214,What good will that do?  Why it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge call in all doubtful loans and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!,CLARK,american madness,drama,joy
7634,m18,2215,How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!,CLARK,american madness,drama,joy
7635,m18,2215,Take it easy Clark.,O'BRIEN,american madness,drama,anger
7636,m18,2216,You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.,O'BRIEN,american madness,drama,joy
7637,m18,2216,All right let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank let him do it. I don't want any part of it.,CLARK,american madness,drama,joy
7638,m18,2217,Say you know I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand and from the inside out it's the only way you can hit anything,DICKSON,american madness,drama,optimism
7639,m18,2217,I think Mr. Dickson we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning if you don't mind.,CLARK,american madness,drama,optimism
7640,m18,2217,Oh you would eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf go ahead. What's on your mind?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7641,m18,2218,What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7642,m18,2218,Just pure luck!,CLARK,american madness,drama,optimism
7643,m18,2219,Character hmmpf! That's your idea?,CLARK,american madness,drama,optimism
7644,m18,2219,Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7645,m18,2220,Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7646,m18,2220,I know Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!,CLARK,american madness,drama,anger
7647,m18,2221,I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7648,m18,2221,Gentlemen you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!,CLARK,american madness,drama,joy
7649,m18,2221,Yes! You said it Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7650,m18,2222,We want to talk to you.,CLARK,american madness,drama,sadness
7651,m18,2222,What about?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,optimism
7652,m18,2222,We'll discuss that in the board room.,CLARK,american madness,drama,anger
7653,m18,2223,We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7654,m18,2223,What do you mean help?,CLARK,american madness,drama,sadness
7655,m18,2223,I know that among you you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7656,m18,2223,That sounds very simple Dickson but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?,CLARK,american madness,drama,anger
7657,m18,2223,I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine isn't it?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7658,m18,2224,The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?,CLARK,american madness,drama,joy
7659,m18,2224,Aw they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7660,m18,2224,No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.,CLARK,american madness,drama,joy
7661,m18,2224,So that's it eh? You've waited a long time for this chance haven't you?  Well I'm not going to resign now - or ever.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7662,m18,2225,Say you can't do that,CLARK,american madness,drama,joy
7663,m18,2225,I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7664,m18,2226,Dickson I'd like to talk to you about the bank.,CLARK,american madness,drama,sadness
7665,m18,2226,The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7666,m18,2227,Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7667,m18,2227,We've been waiting fifteen minutes,CLARK,american madness,drama,optimism
7668,m18,2227,You know what you can do with that! Come on take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7669,m18,2228,I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions Mr. Cluett.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,anger
7670,m18,2228,Of course yes. Just what would you like to know Inspector?,CLUETT,american madness,drama,optimism

7674,m18,2229,Oh yes of course. There was someone with me. A lady.,CLUETT,american madness,drama,optimism
7675,m18,2229,Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name Mr. Cluett?,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,optimism
7676,m18,2229,If you don't mind Inspector I'd rather not say - that is unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see she's married.,CLUETT,american madness,drama,anger
7677,m18,2229,Oh!,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,optimism
7678,m18,2229,You understand?,CLUETT,american madness,drama,optimism

7686,m18,2232,Stand back Inspector. Let me out of here or I'll shoot you!,CLUETT,american madness,drama,joy
7687,m18,2233,What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,optimism
7688,m18,2233,They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.,CLUETT,american madness,drama,sadness
7689,m18,2234,I was crazy I tell you Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me won't you Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!,CLUETT,american madness,drama,joy
7690,m18,2234,Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,sadness
7691,m18,2234,I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!,CLUETT,american madness,drama,joy

7703,m18,2236,She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.,CLUETT,american madness,drama,optimism

7929,m18,2295,Listen Mr. Dickson don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is,MATT,american madness,drama,anger

7934,m18,2296,But I haven't . . .,MATT,american madness,drama,sadness

7937,m18,2297,Gee thanks Mr. Dickson,MATT,american madness,drama,optimism
7938,m18,2298,What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7939,m18,2298,I'm afraid I must Mr. Dickson.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,anger
7940,m18,2298,Why pick on him ?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7941,m18,2298,It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown here is in charge of the vaults isn't he?,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,joy
7942,m18,2298,Yes.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,optimism
7943,m18,2299,What time did this thing happen?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,sadness
7944,m18,2299,The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,sadness
7945,m18,2299,All right. If the boy proves an alibi he's all right isn't he?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7946,m18,2299,If he can do it yes.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,anger
7947,m18,2299,Why certainly he can.  Matt now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night between twelve and twelve-thirty and everything will be all right.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7948,m18,2300,That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,anger
7949,m18,2300,Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in you'll be released.  And listen don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7950,m18,2301,All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it Brown here looks guilty.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,sadness
7951,m18,2301,What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7952,m18,2301,Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why this kid's got a record.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,joy
7953,m18,2301,So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7954,m18,2302,Of course it's true - and he knows it.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,anger
7955,m18,2302,Listen Matt. If you don't tell the truth I can't help you. Where were you last night?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7956,m18,2303,You were right Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,joy
7957,m18,2303,Why you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7958,m18,2303,He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,joy
7959,m18,2304,My wife? What's she got to do with you?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7960,m18,2304,No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,joy
7961,m18,2305,You're lying!,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7962,m18,2305,Don't worry Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.,INSPECTOR,american madness,drama,anger
7963,m18,2305,You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy

7965,m18,2306,Here's the data on the Clyde deal.,SAMPSON,american madness,drama,anger
7966,m18,2307,Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7967,m18,2307,I'm afraid he's been stalling.,SAMPSON,american madness,drama,sadness
7968,m18,2307,That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7969,m18,2307,He says he can't get away in the daytime.,SAMPSON,american madness,drama,sadness
7970,m18,2307,How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open come in and sign this thing or I'll call this whole deal off.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7971,m18,2307,Yes sir.,SAMPSON,american madness,drama,optimism
7972,m18,2308,The lobby's half filled now.,SAMPSON,american madness,drama,sadness
7973,m18,2308,What are you talking about?,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7974,m18,2309,They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.,SAMPSON,american madness,drama,joy
7975,m18,2309,All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,anger
7976,m18,2309,We haven't much on hand you know. If it gets any worse I hope we don't have to close the doors.,SAMPSON,american madness,drama,sadness
7977,m18,2310,The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.,DICKSON,american madness,drama,joy
7978,m18,2310,Yes sir.,SAMPSON,american madness,drama,optimism
7979,m18,2311,Look at them Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.,SAMPSON,american madness,drama,joy

10686,m28,3629,Good morning.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10687,m28,3629,Where are you bound for?,ARMED GENTLEMAN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10688,m28,3629,That is none of your business.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10689,m28,3629,Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?,ARMED GENTLEMAN,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10690,m28,3629,Not at all sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution and are ready to do it again.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10691,m28,3630,And I'll tell you what Mr. Dugan I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman I am and a man of property; and I -- I --,CAPTAIN BEST,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10692,m28,3630,If you're insulted and not satisfied remember there's two of us Best.,HARRY,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10693,m28,3631,Both of us ride home with Best here.,HARRY,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10694,m28,3631,I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed and so am I.,CAPTAIN BEST,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10695,m28,3631,You know the use of arms very well Best and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.,HARRY,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10696,m28,3632,There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground Grogan -- twelve paces I suppose?,HARRY,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10697,m28,3632,Ten sir and make them short ones do you hear Captain Grogan?,CAPTAIN BEST,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10698,m28,3632,Don't bully Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you my boy; and when I count three fire.,HARRY,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10699,m28,3633,Hoity-toity!  John Best what's the matter here?,MICHAEL,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10700,m28,3633,I'll tell you what it is Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em sir.,CAPTAIN BEST,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10701,m28,3633,Well well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways or adopt English ones.,MICHAEL,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10702,m28,3633,It's not the English way for ladies to have two lovers and so Mr. Dugan I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys let her take 'em sir.,CAPTAIN BEST,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10703,m28,3633,Pooh!  Pooh!  Best you are joking.,MICHAEL,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10704,m28,3633,I never was more in earnest.,CAPTAIN BEST,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10705,m28,3634,My companion treated me with great civility and asked me a thousand questions about England which I answered as best I might.  But this best I am bound to say was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10706,m28,3634,What is your uncle's name?,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10707,m28,3634,O'Grady.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10708,m28,3634,Oh yes of course Ambassador O'Grady...,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10709,m28,3635,This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10710,m28,3635,This may be a very good inn for Germany but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off let us push on for Corbach.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10711,m28,3635,Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10712,m28,3636,Ah!  You sly rogue I see that will influence you.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10713,m28,3636,The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10714,m28,3636,The people are great farmers as well as inn-keepers.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10715,m28,3637,Where's the beauty you promised me?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10716,m28,3637,It was my joke.  I was tired and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy my friend then you must wait awhile.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10717,m28,3638,Upon my word sir I think you have acted very coolly.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10718,m28,3638,I have acted as I think fit.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10719,m28,3638,Sir I'm a British officer.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10720,m28,3638,It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty sir or will you be given up?,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10721,m28,3638,Neither!,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10722,m28,3639,Good morning Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10723,m28,3639,How do you do sir?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10724,m28,3640,The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police Herr Galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10725,m28,3640,Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of 100 guineas.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10726,m28,3640,What is the service sir?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10727,m28,3640,There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society polished obliging a libertine without prejudices fond of women of good food of high play prudent and discreet.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10728,m28,3641,You are a Hungarian; you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal and wins.  Do you know the cards well?,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10729,m28,3641,Only a very little as soldiers do.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10730,m28,3641,I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of for how much each plays especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to read his private letters though about those which go to the post you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics if you get an impression of the keys.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10731,m28,3642,What are the Chevalier's intentions?,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10732,m28,3642,I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10733,m28,3643,Has he sent the challenge yet?,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10734,m28,3643,Not yet but I believe he intends to.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10735,m28,3644,You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box and the coachman will get his orders to move on.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10736,m28,3644,And his baggage?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10737,m28,3644,Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers you say; and at noon after parade shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound or you would have got the key long ago.,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10738,m28,3645,This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10739,m28,3645,The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10740,m28,3646,Dorothy might love me or not as she likes but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10741,m28,3646,Faith I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10742,m28,3647,A pretty day's work of it you have made Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past and missing them all and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10743,m28,3647,And so I am.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10744,m28,3647,And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died and hasn't he given you and your mother rent-free your fine house of Jamesville yonder?,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10745,m28,3647,Mark this come what will of it I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church and meet him there. I'll have his blood or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him and arrange the meeting?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10746,m28,3647,Well if it must be it must.  For a young fellow you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer bearing His Majesty's commission can receive a glass of wine on his nose without resenting it -- fight you must and Best is a huge strong fellow.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10747,m28,3647,He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10748,m28,3647,In faith I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives you shall never want a friend or a second.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10749,m28,3648,Have you taken my message to him?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10750,m28,3648,The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10751,m28,3648,My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10752,m28,3648,Your cousins go out with him.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10753,m28,3649,That's a very handsome sword you have there.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10754,m28,3649,It was with this sword that my late father Harry James God rest his soul met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone the Hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong having insulted Lady Fuddelstone when in liquor at the Brentford Assembly.  But like a gentleman he scorned to apologize.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10755,m28,3649,And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed your mother is all alone in the world.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10756,m28,3649,I am Harry James' son and will act as becomes my name and quality.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10757,m28,3650,I hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10758,m28,3650,Oh it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10759,m28,3650,I'll match any man with the sword.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10760,m28,3650,But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night as he was riding home and can scarce move it now.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10761,m28,3650,Not against Castle Dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10762,m28,3650,It must have been some other gate.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10763,m28,3651,Look here Roderick my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best mark my words; and as sure as she does you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology and be off.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10764,m28,3651,A man of honor dies but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10765,m28,3652,Grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which I wanted of my family.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10766,m28,3652,I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith you've begun early like your father's son but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10767,m28,3652,I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10768,m28,3652,"We must write to her today and you can tell her that you are safe and married to """"Brown Bess.""""""",CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10769,m28,3653,I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10770,m28,3653,Is Miss Dugan well?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10771,m28,3653,There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10772,m28,3653,Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10773,m28,3653,She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10774,m28,3653,Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10775,m28,3653,No the very same one my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did Roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10776,m28,3653,The coward!,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10777,m28,3653,He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith the business was well done.  Your cousins Michael and Harry never let him out of their sight though he was for deserting to England until the marriage was completed and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash my boy?  You may draw upon me for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and while they last you shall never want.,CAPTAIN GROGAN,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10778,m28,3654,Mr. O'Higgins I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10779,m28,3654,I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10780,m28,3654,Mr. O'Higgins we are in your debt and rest assured sir you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins I wonder if I know your good father?,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10781,m28,3654,Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10782,m28,3654,Oh I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father Colonel Granby Somerset.,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10783,m28,3654,Ah -- I see.  No I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10784,m28,3654,I have heard of them.,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10785,m28,3655,Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you sirrah?,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10786,m28,3655,Sirrah!  Sirrah I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10787,m28,3655,You're an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver!,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10788,m28,3655,Repeat the words again and I run you through the body.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10789,m28,3655,Tut tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color do you?  Your secret is known is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds and what do I find?  A fraud.,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10790,m28,3656,Chevalier though I cannot say how I believe you have cheated me.,PRINCE,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10791,m28,3656,I deny your Grace's accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated?,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10792,m28,3656,I don't know.,PRINCE,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10793,m28,3656,Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which I have honorably won.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10794,m28,3656,Chevalier if you will have your money now you must fight for it. If you will be patient maybe I will pay you something another time.,PRINCE,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10795,m28,3656,Your Grace if I am so tame as to take this then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,anger

10798,m28,3657,I will let down the steps for your honor.,PRUSSIAN OFFICER,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10799,m28,3658,Good gracious!  What is this?,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10800,m28,3658,You are going to drive to the frontier.,PRUSSIAN OFFICER,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10801,m28,3658,It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,joy

10813,m28,3661,You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10814,m28,3661,Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10815,m28,3661,For whom else have you worked?,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10816,m28,3661,No one sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10817,m28,3661,Who else can give me information about you?,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10818,m28,3661,Only the agency of servants.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10819,m28,3662,And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10820,m28,3662,I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10821,m28,3663,The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property look you and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me why my dear my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10822,m28,3663,I can play as soldiers do but have no great skill.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10823,m28,3663,We will practice in the mornings my boy and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10824,m28,3664,But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10825,m28,3664,Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10826,m28,3664,I believe they will deport you.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10827,m28,3664,I have faced that problem before.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10828,m28,3664,But if they send you away then what is to become of me?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10829,m28,3664,Make your mind easy you shall not be left behind I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10830,m28,3664,But how sir?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10831,m28,3665,Gentlemen I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10832,m28,3665,Then ordering fresh horses the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10833,m28,3666,When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags what did we ask?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10834,m28,3666,Sir we have but eighty thousand florins in bank or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand we will meet you.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10835,m28,3667,It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10836,m28,3667,To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10837,m28,3667,I risk nothing for I am certain to kill him.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10838,m28,3667,Certain?,CHEVALIER,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10839,m28,3667,Perfectly certain because I shall make him tremble.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10840,m28,3668,I entered here monsieur at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.,COUNT,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10841,m28,3668,Certainly monseigneur does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10842,m28,3668,Perfectly so; and what is more I will tell you that I love her and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.,COUNT,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10843,m28,3668,Very well!  Now that I know it I will no longer love her.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10844,m28,3668,Then you yield to me.,COUNT,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10845,m28,3668,On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10846,m28,3668,Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.,COUNT,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10847,m28,3668,That is a trifle strong.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10848,m28,3668,Take to your legs low Irish dog.,COUNT,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10849,m28,3669,No.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10850,m28,3669,Have you had one?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10851,m28,3669,Never.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10852,m28,3669,But for a time... a passing fancy?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10853,m28,3669,Not even that.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10854,m28,3669,How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10855,m28,3669,Not one.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10856,m28,3669,Have you not a man whom you value?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10857,m28,3669,That man has perhaps not yet been born.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10858,m28,3669,What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10859,m28,3670,You want my heart?,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10860,m28,3670,It is my only object.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10861,m28,3670,To make me wretched in two weeks.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10862,m28,3670,To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10863,m28,3670,The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10864,m28,3670,Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it I am innocent.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10865,m28,3670,But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10866,m28,3671,Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10867,m28,3671,With a woman who is completely charming be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition and who regardless of her rank will show me some kindness tonight.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10868,m28,3672,And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10869,m28,3672,Then I will respectfully take leave of her.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10870,m28,3672,You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10871,m28,3672,Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10872,m28,3672,Poor man.  And for that reason you want to begin where people end?,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10873,m28,3672,I ask only a payment on account today -- after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10874,m28,3673,Will we always leave it at this?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10875,m28,3673,Always my dear one never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10876,m28,3673,I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare and if it is stubbornly withheld it withers away.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10877,m28,3673,Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10878,m28,3673,Let us give each other complete happiness and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires they will each time be born anew.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10879,m28,3673,My husband has convinced me of the contrary.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10880,m28,3673,Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases and no veil keeps his senses his eyes his soul from enjoying your beauty.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10881,m28,3674,Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me I was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10882,m28,3674,O my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips and give me yours!,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10883,m28,3675,Without you my dearest I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10884,m28,3675,Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10885,m28,3675,As soon as I saw you loved me I was pleased and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part I would never love you.  But after our first kiss I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10886,m28,3675,"We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that from time to time her ladyship cried out:  """"Oh my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?""""""",RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10887,m28,3676,My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day I was joking her and asking her whether she would take the water again whether she had found another lover and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears and after a while said to me:,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10888,m28,3676,Roderick you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you I saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me.,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10889,m28,3677,Lady Cosgrove you are an old fool.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10890,m28,3677,Old fool!,COUNTESS,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10891,m28,3678,I accept but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10892,m28,3678,Agreed.,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10893,m28,3678,Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10894,m28,3679,I feel the ribbon.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10895,m28,3679,Then you must get it.,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10896,m28,3680,Why are you shaking?,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,sadness
10897,m28,3680,With pleasure at finding the ribbon.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10898,m28,3681,I hate Miss Clancy you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10899,m28,3681,I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10900,m28,3681,Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best and then stroll out with him into the garden?,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10901,m28,3681,I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals too; and if he chose to ask me to dance how could I refuse him?,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10902,m28,3681,But you refused me Dorothy.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10903,m28,3681,Oh!  I can dance with you any day and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides Roderick Captain Best's a man and you are only a boy and you haven't a guinea in the world.,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10904,m28,3681,If ever I meet him again you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol captain as he is.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10905,m28,3681,But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10906,m28,3682,Suppose now Roderick you who are such a hero was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10907,m28,3682,I'd draw my sword and cut my way through them.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10908,m28,3682,What with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10909,m28,3682,Well then I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10910,m28,3682,Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse Black George I've heard say that Captain Bes --,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,anger
10911,m28,3683,Monster!  Your father was a tailor and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge I will!  Roddy will you see me insulted?,DOROTHY,barry lyndon,drama,joy
10912,m28,3683,Indeed Miss Dorothy I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10913,m28,3684,I am at your service Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?,HENRI,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10914,m28,3684,As much as possible.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10915,m28,3684,As much as possible?,HENRI,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10916,m28,3684,Yes for I wish to entertain splendidly.,RODERICK,barry lyndon,drama,optimism
10917,m29,3709,Don't like 'em don't eat 'em don't make no damn difference to me.,BARTENDER,basic,crime,joy
10918,m29,3709,You know that was like a quadruple negative?,HARDY,basic,crime,sadness
10919,m29,3710,Can I at least have a drink?,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
10920,m29,3710,It's ten thirty in the morning.,BARTENDER,basic,crime,optimism
10921,m29,3710,Yeah if you've slept.,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
10922,m29,3710,You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.,BARTENDER,basic,crime,joy

10924,m29,3711,Hurricane kept you up too?,BARTENDER,basic,crime,sadness
10925,m29,3711,Yeah and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight try and get some work going.,HARDY,basic,crime,sadness

10985,m29,3736,Why'd you ask for a cop Ray?,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
10986,m29,3736,I'm not telling you what happened.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
10987,m29,3736,Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
10988,m29,3737,Some.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
10989,m29,3737,Tell me about them.,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
10990,m29,3738,And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
10991,m29,3738,Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
10992,m29,3739,You smoke Ray?,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
10993,m29,3739,This is one of those interrogation tricks isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
10994,m29,3739,No actually I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
10995,m29,3740,Hey Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
10996,m29,3740,That son of a bitch.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
10997,m29,3740,That'd be my reaction too --,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
10998,m29,3740,He's lying.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
10999,m29,3740,Well why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges then --,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11000,m29,3740,I'm serious --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
11001,m29,3741,"Fuck """"you're serious"""" Raymond you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours so if you've got something to say say it.""",HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11002,m29,3741,Did Kendall tell you about the PX?,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
11003,m29,3742,So Childs made some side money so what? People are dead Ray and the only one we have to blame is you --,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11004,m29,3742,I didn't shoot West --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
11005,m29,3742,Yeah we know Pike did.,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
11006,m29,3743,I apologize --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism

11008,m29,3743,Of course --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
11009,m29,3744,And he'd been shot.,HARDY,basic,crime,sadness
11010,m29,3744,Yeah --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
11011,m29,3745,You shot Childs and Nunez.,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11012,m29,3745,They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession I'll write a confession.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
11013,m29,3745,You saved Kendall's life --,HARDY,basic,crime,optimism
11014,m29,3745,But not Pike's.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11015,m29,3746,Raymond for you to have any chance of coming out of this we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11016,m29,3746,Mr. Hardy I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me then go find them. I don't want to die.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
11017,m29,3747,We're not finished yet --,HARDY,basic,crime,anger
11018,m29,3747,You wanna bet?,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
11019,m29,3748,We don't need the tapes --,HARDY,basic,crime,sadness

11025,m29,3750,Do what?,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11026,m29,3750,Hunting -- we had to hunt him --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11027,m29,3751,I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
11028,m29,3751,And the bodies?,HARDY,basic,crime,sadness
11029,m29,3751,You won't find them. Won't find West either. He's too good.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,anger
11030,m29,3752,I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...,HARDY,basic,crime,sadness

11033,m29,3753,Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,joy
11034,m29,3753,No ma'am he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight Command would consider you at the top of the class.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
11035,m29,3754,That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11036,m29,3754,Tell us about the other guys the ones West weeded out.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,anger
11037,m29,3754,There were six of us...,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11038,m29,3755,He was sickly. Had that shaking thing whatd'yacall it epoxy?,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11039,m29,3755,Epilepsy.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,sadness
11040,m29,3755,Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11041,m29,3756,He said he worked there --,OSBORNE,basic,crime,optimism
11042,m29,3756,No did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11043,m29,3756,What business?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,sadness
11044,m29,3756,Pills shots you name it Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11045,m29,3757,Where?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,optimism
11046,m29,3757,The creek bed --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11047,m29,3758,What about the phosphorous grenade?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,joy
11048,m29,3758,One went off yeah but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy

11050,m29,3759,Mueller was alone in the cabin?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,sadness
11051,m29,3759,Yeah.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,optimism
11052,m29,3760,Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,joy
11053,m29,3760,Would you have believed me?,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11054,m29,3761,Where's the cabin?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,sadness
11055,m29,3761,Don't know on a map. West told us it was there we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11056,m29,3762,You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him too.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,joy
11057,m29,3762,Can't do that now though can you?,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11058,m29,3763,Is that what I did now? And of course you can prove all of it.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,anger
11059,m29,3763,We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --,OSBORNE,basic,crime,joy
11060,m29,3763,Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
11061,m29,3764,Ohhhh I don't think so...,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11062,m29,3764,How do you know that?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,sadness
11063,m29,3764,Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies no crime and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
11064,m29,3765,Cadet what's your name!,WEST,basic,crime,optimism

11068,m29,3766,Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food water or clothes! If he so much as moves you are to blow his nigger brains out is that clear?,WEST,basic,crime,joy

11070,m29,3766,The rest of you fallout for physicals!,WEST,basic,crime,joy

11098,m29,3779,You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing Ray.,PIKE,basic,crime,joy
11099,m29,3779,You hated West more than any of us.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
11100,m29,3779,Maybe but that don't make me a killer --,PIKE,basic,crime,sadness
11101,m29,3779,You're the only one missing a grenade.,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11102,m29,3779,Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?,PIKE,basic,crime,sadness

11106,m29,3780,Oh come on --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,sadness
11107,m29,3780,We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --,PIKE,basic,crime,joy

11109,m29,3780,Who you gonna trust Ray? Him or your friend?,PIKE,basic,crime,joy
11110,m29,3781,You hated West Mueller loved him --,DUNBAR,basic,crime,joy
11111,m29,3781,Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam Mueller was in on it --,PIKE,basic,crime,joy

11135,m29,3787,We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face a criminal record and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them Ray and you gotta decide right now.,PIKE,basic,crime,joy
11136,m29,3788,A test will no doubt link you to the killing --,PIKE,basic,crime,joy

11366,m29,3860,"Oh spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my """"great second chance"""" Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --""",HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11367,m29,3860,But you will.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,anger
11368,m29,3861,Why do you care?,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11369,m29,3861,Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that.  We can do this Hardy.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,anger
11370,m29,3862,I didn't shoot West...,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11371,m29,3862,What?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,optimism
11372,m29,3862,Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11373,m29,3863,At least you and Kendall agree on that.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,anger
11374,m29,3863,What happened next?,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11375,m29,3864,Talk it through: Childs Mueller and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill hurricane or no hurricane so they plan it: Kill West pin it on Pike.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,joy
11376,m29,3864,And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated you need a fall guy and for that to work you have to have a witness.,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11377,m29,3864,Dunbar.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,optimism
11378,m29,3864,Exactly someone who's not involved who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see you make them believe so when the time comes they've totally bought into your version of events.,HARDY,basic,crime,joy
11379,m29,3864,They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,anger
11380,m29,3864,And if they're asked that's what they'll tell the world.,HARDY,basic,crime,anger
11381,m29,3864,So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --,OSBORNE,basic,crime,joy
11382,m29,3864,Kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --,HARDY,basic,crime,sadness
11383,m29,3864,Buttfucks the cabin?,OSBORNE,basic,crime,joy

11408,m29,3871,You know you never told me why you left the army.,OSBORNE,basic,crime,joy
11409,m29,3871,It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus I got kicked out.,HARDY,basic,crime,joy

13163,m43,6068,As it happens I'm headed for Frisco myself.,CHUCK,cast away,adventure,anger
13164,m43,6068,Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy cranberries baked potatoes with all the trimmings fresh- baked bread apple pie...,CHUCK/CAPTAIN,cast away,adventure,optimism
13165,m43,6068,No please join me.  Some sundried fish strips a few eyeballs some gills to munch on.,CHUCK,cast away,adventure,optimism
13166,m45,6262,But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.,LILY,confidence,crime,joy
13167,m45,6262,I wasn't sure if you'd make it.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,sadness
13168,m45,6263,Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.,LILY,confidence,crime,optimism
13169,m45,6263,Tough day?,ASHBY,confidence,crime,sadness
13170,m45,6263,Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?,LILY,confidence,crime,sadness
13171,m45,6263,Uh Maker's Mark. Rocks.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,anger
13172,m45,6264,My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13173,m45,6264,Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.,LILY,confidence,crime,joy
13174,m45,6265,So what do you do?,ASHBY,confidence,crime,sadness
13175,m45,6265,It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley but then again who hasn't up there.,LILY,confidence,crime,anger
13176,m45,6265,Silicon Valley?,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13177,m45,6265,That's right. So brainiacs that we are we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.,LILY,confidence,crime,anger
13178,m45,6266,Can --,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13179,m45,6266,On me. For the seat. Cheers.,LILY,confidence,crime,optimism
13180,m45,6267,"So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say """"no"""" without ever using the word.""",LILY,confidence,crime,anger
13181,m45,6267,Well typically corporate loans are relatively simple matters but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,anger
13182,m45,6268,Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.,LILY,confidence,crime,joy
13183,m45,6268,No no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,joy
13184,m45,6268,Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.,LILY,confidence,crime,sadness
13185,m45,6269,Oh. Well thanks for the drink.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13186,m45,6269,You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.,LILY,confidence,crime,optimism
13187,m45,6270,Uh right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13188,m45,6270,I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13189,m45,6271,What do you do over at your bank Grant?,JAKE,confidence,crime,sadness
13190,m45,6271,What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,anger
13191,m45,6272,Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie but now we're sure he's playing.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13192,m45,6272,Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13193,m45,6272,Well typically speaking they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --,ASHBY,confidence,crime,anger
13194,m45,6272,A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah we got that part.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13195,m45,6272,That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,joy
13196,m45,6272,They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13197,m45,6272,Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,joy
13198,m45,6272,We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22,JAKE,confidence,crime,sadness
13199,m45,6272,I don't follow.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,sadness
13200,m45,6273,Listen what I'm about to tell you I'm telling you in confidence okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13201,m45,6273,Big.Com. That Internet thing.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13202,m45,6273,Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea shop it around raise some capital then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft Intel Oracle whatever. The beauty of it is they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital make it work then sell it for like five times the initial loan.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13203,m45,6273,Sort of like a letter of intent.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13204,m45,6273,Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer because if it's public you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13205,m45,6273,And you have this letter of intent?,ASHBY,confidence,crime,joy
13206,m45,6273,Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13207,m45,6274,We had to finalize the deal.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13208,m45,6274,Everything looks in order.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,anger
13209,m45,6274,This has to happen fast.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13210,m45,6274,I know. It won't go unnoticed.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,anger
13211,m45,6274,There'll be red flags.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13212,m45,6275,What's this?,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13213,m45,6275,You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13214,m45,6276,Let's just slow down for a second...,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13215,m45,6276,You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13216,m45,6276,No I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well my cut.,ASHBY,confidence,crime,sadness
13217,m45,6277,Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13218,m45,6277,The standard ten.,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13219,m45,6277,Ten percent. Of how much?,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13220,m45,6277,Two million.,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13221,m45,6278,Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13222,m45,6278,Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah it's going through --,ASHBY,confidence,crime,optimism
13223,m45,6279,Hey Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?,BIG AL,confidence,crime,sadness
13224,m45,6279,Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13225,m45,6279,Yeah but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.,BIG AL,confidence,crime,joy
13226,m45,6279,What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up do you?,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13227,m45,6279,I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?,BIG AL,confidence,crime,optimism
13228,m45,6280,It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.,JAKE,confidence,crime,sadness
13229,m45,6280,It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.,BIG AL,confidence,crime,joy
13230,m45,6281,And I think it's because of this redhead...,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13231,m45,6281,Know who I am Jake?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13232,m45,6281,The Anti-Christ?,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13233,m45,6281,No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,anger
13234,m45,6282,Things are probably going to end badly for you Jake.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,sadness
13235,m45,6282,Gee... What makes you say that?,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13236,m45,6282,Your life flashing before your eyes?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,sadness
13237,m45,6282,Just the last three weeks.,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13238,m45,6282,That's not a bad place to start.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,anger
13239,m45,6283,Grifters...,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13240,m45,6283,We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13241,m45,6283,It's all about the money isn't it?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13242,m45,6283,Isn't it always?,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13243,m45,6284,I'm not saying anything. Besides you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13244,m45,6284,And these cops? What do they get?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,joy
13245,m45,6285,Keeping the Fix happy.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13246,m45,6285,You never know when you can use a crooked cop.,JAKE,confidence,crime,sadness
13247,m45,6285,Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,anger
13248,m45,6285,So you want to know how to play the Big Con.,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13249,m45,6285,In this case you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,joy
13250,m45,6286,So how'd you get caught?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,sadness
13251,m45,6286,Suits used to say that in any con sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually it takes a little longer.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13252,m45,6287,I can see why you liked her.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13253,m45,6287,That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13254,m45,6288,But there were other factors.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13255,m45,6288,Factors that weren't clear to me until now.,JAKE,confidence,crime,sadness
13256,m45,6289,He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13257,m45,6289,Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,joy
13258,m45,6290,Nice.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13259,m45,6290,We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13260,m45,6291,Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13261,m45,6291,Back in WWI or WWII one of the WW's if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13262,m45,6291,You're a superstitious fucker.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,joy
13263,m45,6291,Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13264,m45,6291,Like what?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13265,m45,6291,Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck but it's bad. Three on a match black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13266,m45,6292,She had you tempting fate.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,sadness
13267,m45,6292,My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.,JAKE,confidence,crime,joy
13268,m45,6293,Is that what it was Jake? Was it love?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13269,m45,6293,You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13270,m45,6294,So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends your girl...,BUTCH,confidence,crime,joy
13271,m45,6294,I was doing it for them.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13272,m45,6294,BULLSHIT! You were scared Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,joy

13279,m45,6296,Today? Started off great...,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism
13280,m45,6297,Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit unless I get that money. Where is it?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,joy
13281,m45,6297,Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13282,m45,6298,Oh Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,joy
13283,m45,6298,It's like putting on a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark.,JAKE,confidence,crime,anger
13284,m45,6298,Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,sadness
13285,m45,6298,Guess so.,JAKE,confidence,crime,optimism

13287,m45,6299,Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?,BUTCH,confidence,crime,sadness
13288,m45,6299,Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.,GILLETTE,confidence,crime,joy
13289,m45,6299,So we go to the bar.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,optimism
13290,m45,6299,I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off great. Have someone deal with Ashby.,GILLETTE,confidence,crime,joy
13291,m45,6299,We'll take care of it.,BUTCH,confidence,crime,anger
13292,m45,6299,And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?,GILLETTE,confidence,crime,joy

13302,m45,6302,What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.,GORDO,confidence,crime,joy

13386,m53,7195,She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant.

13396,m53,7198,I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well too but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,anger
13397,m53,7198,What do you mean?,ANNE,the elephant man,biography,optimism
13398,m53,7198,Well I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear and he was trying to please me.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,joy

13402,m53,7199,I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man trapped in the body of a monster then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind free that spirit as best I can to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch well then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered I won't be bothered and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,joy

13419,m53,7205,Oh Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?,ANNE,the elephant man,biography,joy
13420,m53,7205,That I am very little different from him.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,sadness
13421,m53,7205,Oh that's absurd Frederick. No no Frederick that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And that is completely due to you.,ANNE,the elephant man,biography,anger
13422,m53,7205,But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,sadness
13423,m53,7205,Frederick just what is it that you are saying?,ANNE,the elephant man,biography,joy

I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.",TREVES,the elephant man,biography,anger

13503,m53,7223,...Yes Sir.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,optimism
13504,m53,7224,It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth.

13506,m53,7225,...As I said it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him and he's most anxious to make a good impression so he might seem rather nervous.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,sadness
13507,m53,7225,He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?,CARR,the elephant man,biography,joy
13508,m53,7225,Yes I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting so we should have their answers shortly.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,anger
13509,m53,7225,Fine fine. You know your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital and there are many patients here.

13514,m53,7227,I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me Frederick it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.,CARR,the elephant man,biography,sadness
13515,m53,7228,How did you know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,sadness

13757,m53,7295,I've heard.,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,anger
13758,m53,7295,Yes... Well I want you to clear up a little mess a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that you and I shall give the man a bath.

13766,m53,7298,No he's very upset about something.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,sadness
13767,m53,7298,Just being obstinate sir. I'll handle it.,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,joy
13768,m53,7299,"He's had his share of """"smacks"""" Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.""",TREVES,the elephant man,biography,anger
13769,m53,7299,Perhaps you've got the time for that Mr. Treves I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,joy
13770,m53,7300,Good Lord Mr. Treves!,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,optimism
13771,m53,7300,We've made tremendous strides today Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention and this certainly isn't easy for him.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,anger
13772,m53,7300,Parrots can do as much Mr. Treves. It's all very nice but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,joy
13773,m53,7300,I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good John very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,anger
13774,m53,7301,Watery headed bunch.,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,joy

13779,m53,7302,I can't understand why you let those people go in there sir.,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,joy
13780,m53,7302,Now Mothershead you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,anger
13781,m53,7302,But you saw them sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John they're just trying to impress their friends.,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,joy
13782,m53,7302,Aren't you being just a little harsh Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,joy
13783,m53,7302,I bathed him didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern then yes I did treat him with loving kindness and I'm not ashamed to say it.,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,anger
13784,m53,7302,You're right Mothershead please forgive me... Of course I appreciate everything you've done for John and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late so please forgive me.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,anger
13785,m53,7303,Mr. Treves some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,optimism

13793,m53,7303,Well...,MOTHERSHEAD,the elephant man,biography,optimism
13794,m53,7303,John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,optimism
13795,m53,7304,So you see John there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.,TREVES,the elephant man,biography,anger

15463,m71,9821,Pretty handy with that scatter gun Epps. You raised on a farm?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15464,m71,9821,Seen a lota movies.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15465,m71,9822,Smokes?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15466,m71,9822,Oh yeah.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15467,m71,9823,I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15468,m71,9823,A what?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15469,m71,9823,I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15470,m71,9823,I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15471,m71,9824,Other than the obvious there's nothing wrong with him that I can see not on the outside.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,joy
15472,m71,9824,Then what the hell happened to him?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15473,m71,9825,Try Wednesday.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15474,m71,9825,Right. Wednesday.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15475,m71,9826,Did you?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15476,m71,9826,Hell no. You think I'm crazy?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15477,m71,9827,What say Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15478,m71,9827,Why not?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15479,m71,9828,Dodge.  Dodge.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,joy
15480,m71,9828,What?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15481,m71,9828,Get up.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,anger
15482,m71,9828,Yeah yeah.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15483,m71,9829,You aren't jealous are you Dodge?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15484,m71,9829,Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15485,m71,9830,What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15486,m71,9830,Smugglers maybe.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15487,m71,9831,Yeah from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15488,m71,9831,You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15489,m71,9831,If you get it back in one piece.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15490,m71,9831,It's a risk I'm willing to take.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15491,m71,9832,It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15492,m71,9832,The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15493,m71,9833,With a little extra fuel weather permitting we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15494,m71,9833,Sounds reasonable.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15495,m71,9834,Mother fucker!,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15496,m71,9834,What is it?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15497,m71,9834,Threw a turbine blade.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15498,m71,9835,The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs but it's way underpowered.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15499,m71,9835,How long to fix?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15500,m71,9835,Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15501,m71,9836,What's this?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15502,m71,9836,Turbine rotor's shot.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15503,m71,9836,I thought you said it was just a blade.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15504,m71,9836,Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15505,m71,9836,How much longer's that gonna take?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15506,m71,9836,Like I always say --,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15507,m71,9836,I know I know two ways to do anything --,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15508,m71,9836,The right way and the wrong way.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15509,m71,9836,But how long?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15510,m71,9836,Hard to say.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15511,m71,9837,Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15512,m71,9837,Man it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15513,m71,9838,Went aboard.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15514,m71,9838,She take a radio?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15515,m71,9839,It's a hell of a lot of money.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15516,m71,9839,What you think there's something funny about it?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15517,m71,9839,A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15518,m71,9840,Didn't happen yesterday I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15519,m71,9840,Then it happened before they scuttled her.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15520,m71,9841,Or somebody stopped them.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15521,m71,9841,Either way they must've had a pretty good reason.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15522,m71,9842,So what're we gonna do. That's the big question right?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15523,m71,9842,A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15524,m71,9842,Then we're rich. We're damn filthy stinking rich.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15525,m71,9842,It looks like it.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15526,m71,9843,You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15527,m71,9843,So we get a little more for the boat. Besides the gold'll be safer where it is.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15528,m71,9844,Yeah yeah. I'm on it.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15529,m71,9844,The sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending what's ours.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15530,m71,9845,I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15531,m71,9845,How about you Epps?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15532,m71,9846,Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15533,m71,9846,Yeah yeah.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15534,m71,9847,Sounds like the hull.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15535,m71,9847,Warm water current maybe making the metal expand.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15536,m71,9848,If somebody's aboard her already she ain't ours. She's theirs.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15537,m71,9848,Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15538,m71,9848,Not in the eyes of the law.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15539,m71,9849,I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15540,m71,9849,And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15541,m71,9849,Why not? Why the fuck not?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15542,m71,9850,What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15543,m71,9850,We'll stand a watch. Four on eight off. Low man first.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15544,m71,9851,If he's reasonable maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15545,m71,9851,Yeah reconsider fucking his shit up.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15546,m71,9852,Bodies're too fresh.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15547,m71,9852,Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15548,m71,9853,Damn barbaric is what it is.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15549,m71,9853,Could be meant as a warning.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15550,m71,9854,That'd be my guess.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15551,m71,9854,So whoever did this might still be around.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15552,m71,9855,Can't you use something else?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15553,m71,9855,I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15554,m71,9855,Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15555,m71,9855,Right.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15556,m71,9856,Dodge to Murphy.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15557,m71,9856,Murphy.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15558,m71,9856,"You better get down here quick skipper. I'm on """"C"""" deck. Cabin 400.""",DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15559,m71,9856,What is it?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15560,m71,9856,I think you better see this for yourself.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15561,m71,9857,It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15562,m71,9857,Not me.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15563,m71,9858,On a passenger ship in 1953?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15564,m71,9858,If they knew what they were carrying.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15565,m71,9859,So. I got a question. Just from a you know purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15566,m71,9859,How do you mean?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15567,m71,9859,Well they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15568,m71,9859,I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15569,m71,9859,Yeah well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved that's a whole new deal.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15570,m71,9859,What do you propose?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15571,m71,9859,For starters getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15572,m71,9860,There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides it'll be safer where it is.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15573,m71,9860,With all due respect skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15574,m71,9861,Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15575,m71,9861,I don't know what you're talking about?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15576,m71,9861,I think you know.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15577,m71,9861,Maybe you can tell me then.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15578,m71,9862,The radio!,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15579,m71,9862,The radio. Oh yeah the radio.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15580,m71,9863,Take it easy willya? What about the radio?!,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15581,m71,9863,You smashed it!,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15582,m71,9863,What?!,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15583,m71,9863,Don't lie to me!,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15584,m71,9863,What the fuck -- ?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15585,m71,9863,You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15586,m71,9863,I didn't touch the fucking radio.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15587,m71,9864,I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat skipper?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15588,m71,9864,Conveniently enough for you.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15589,m71,9864,Look I didn't touch it. Alright?,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15590,m71,9865,Yeah.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15591,m71,9865,You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,anger
15592,m71,9866,What the hell happened!,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15593,m71,9866,Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,joy
15594,m71,9867,That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15595,m71,9867,If money can buy what he wants.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15596,m71,9867,I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15597,m71,9867,Then you're a lucky man.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15598,m71,9868,We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15599,m71,9868,Right.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15600,m71,9869,Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15601,m71,9869,There's a charming thought.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15602,m71,9870,You're late.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15603,m71,9870,Sorry.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15604,m71,9870,Don't fall asleep.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15605,m71,9870,Right.,DODGE,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15606,m71,9871,What's slow?,GREER,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15607,m71,9871,Maybe twenty gallons an hour.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15608,m71,9872,Morning everybody.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15609,m71,9872,Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you Epps?,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15610,m71,9872,Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15611,m71,9872,I bet you did.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,joy
15612,m71,9873,Could be a fishing boat.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15613,m71,9873,Too big. More like a freighter.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15614,m71,9874,Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,joy
15615,m71,9874,He'd let you off at the nearest port that's for sure.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,joy
15616,m71,9875,You mean before she sank.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15617,m71,9875,Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15618,m71,9876,Then why didn't they take it.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,joy
15619,m71,9876,Probably didn't have time.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15620,m71,9877,Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15621,m71,9877,That's what I call a payday.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15622,m71,9877,Hell yeah.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15623,m71,9878,That's a good thing?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15624,m71,9878,Hell yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15625,m71,9879,What'd he look like?,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15626,m71,9879,Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,anger
15627,m71,9880,Coffee.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15628,m71,9880,You're a pal.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15629,m71,9881,Stay away. Or else.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,anger
15630,m71,9881,Because of the gold.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15631,m71,9882,Any dizziness?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15632,m71,9882,No.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15633,m71,9882,Headache nausea lights?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15634,m71,9882,Lights?,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15635,m71,9882,Sudden flashes of light.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15636,m71,9882,I feel fine.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15637,m71,9883,I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15638,m71,9883,Better than starving to death.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15639,m71,9884,You okay?,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15640,m71,9884,Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15641,m71,9884,What?,GREER,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15642,m71,9884,Nothing. Let's get outa here.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15643,m71,9885,I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,joy
15644,m71,9885,I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.,GREER,ghost ship,horror,joy
15645,m71,9886,Candy?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15646,m71,9886,It's my pen name.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15647,m71,9887,Go on.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15648,m71,9887,Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15649,m71,9888,The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it let them try.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15650,m71,9888,They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,joy
15651,m71,9889,Coffee?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15652,m71,9889,Yeah. Thanks.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15653,m71,9890,What'd you find up there?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15654,m71,9890,Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15655,m71,9890,She was sailing up north right?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15656,m71,9890,Her destination was Halifax yeah.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15657,m71,9890,Well suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15658,m71,9891,Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15659,m71,9891,Nope.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15660,m71,9891,She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding they found her completely deserted. The captain his wife their daughter and the entire crew all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15661,m71,9891,So what did happen?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15662,m71,9891,Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories of course. But we'll never really know for sure.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger

15666,m71,9892,Only way to be.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15667,m71,9893,Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,joy
15668,m71,9893,Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15669,m71,9894,Why not call for help?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,anger
15670,m71,9894,For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger

15674,m71,9895,The guy. He just came this way.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism

15676,m71,9895,There's somebody else on this boat.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15677,m71,9895,What? What the hell're you talking about.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy
15678,m71,9895,I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism

15680,m71,9895,Of course I'm sure. I saw him.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,anger
15681,m71,9896,So we find this guy and make a deal with him.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,anger
15682,m71,9896,We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15683,m71,9897,Guess that'd be me. Again.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15684,m71,9897,Dodge get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy

15692,m71,9900,Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,joy
15693,m71,9901,Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,optimism

15696,m71,9902,He needs a doctor.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15697,m71,9902,I'll call us in. Dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,anger
15698,m71,9903,How's he doing?,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15699,m71,9903,Same. Any luck?,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,optimism
15700,m71,9903,No. I'll try again later.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15701,m71,9904,They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.,EPPS,ghost ship,horror,sadness
15702,m71,9904,Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy

15732,m71,9913,Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune.

15778,m71,9927,It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too except he went nuts. Couldn't take it I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.,MURPHY,ghost ship,horror,joy

18082,m112,15802,No.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18083,m112,15802,I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is you can put your trap down but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.,ANDY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18084,m112,15802,What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18085,m112,15802,Well then you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.,ANDY,knight moves,mystery,joy

18112,m112,15811,I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So I figured I'd give him a call have him come down here and look through your records.  You know give him something to do.,ANDY,knight moves,mystery,sadness

18218,m112,15845,Have you any idea what the message is?,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18219,m112,15845,If it's so important why don't you just tell me?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18220,m112,15845,I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18221,m112,15845,You like to brag don't you?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18222,m112,15846,What?,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18223,m112,15846,You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18224,m112,15846,What makes you think I was there?,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18225,m112,15846,I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18226,m112,15846,The game's almost over Peter and you're running out of time.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18227,m112,15847,It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well I'm closer than you think pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18228,m112,15847,Very nice speech Peter.  Did you rehearse that or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18229,m112,15848,Hello.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism

18233,m112,15848,You're next move should have been e2- e3.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger

18235,m112,15848,What word did you leave last night?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18236,m112,15848,The police haven't told you?,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18237,m112,15848,They think that you and I are doing this together.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18238,m112,15849,Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18239,m112,15849,I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18240,m112,15849,--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,joy

18245,m112,15850,By that time the game will be over.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18246,m112,15850,I've figured out the message.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18247,m112,15850,No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you and you've just used your only phone call.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18248,m112,15851,Yes?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18249,m112,15851,Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check Peter.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18250,m112,15851,Let me speak to my daughter.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18251,m112,15851,She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18252,m112,15851,Please... wait.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18253,m112,15851,The game's over.  You lost.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18254,m112,15851,It's me you want.  Not her.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18255,m112,15851,No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18256,m112,15852,"That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  """"His play is always fair and just.""""""",PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger

18259,m112,15852,Don't beg Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18260,m112,15853,I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.,CALLER,knight moves,mystery,sadness

18269,m112,15856,Yes I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18270,m112,15856,They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.,DAVID,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18271,m112,15856,I know but this isn't going to bring her back.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18272,m112,15857,Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.,DAVID,knight moves,mystery,anger
18273,m112,15857,I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down David.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy

18296,m112,15866,You still haven't figured it out have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.,DAVID,knight moves,mystery,joy
18297,m112,15866,What scars?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18298,m112,15866,The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.,DAVID,knight moves,mystery,joy
18299,m112,15867,You might not have done it had you known.,DOCTOR FULTON,knight moves,mystery,anger
18300,m112,15867,You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18301,m112,15867,Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.,DOCTOR FULTON,knight moves,mystery,joy
18302,m112,15867,Oh well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests would we?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18303,m112,15868,The police came to me for help.  What could I do?,DOCTOR FULTON,knight moves,mystery,joy
18304,m112,15868,You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger

18306,m112,15868,--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus Alan the guy could be a psychopath.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy

18313,m112,15870,You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.,DOCTOR FULTON,knight moves,mystery,joy
18314,m112,15870,How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere there has to be a history.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18315,m112,15871,Kathy please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.,DOCTOR FULTON,knight moves,mystery,joy

18330,m112,15875,So are you having a good time on the Island?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18331,m112,15875,Not really.  It's pretty boring.,ERICA,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18332,m112,15875,That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism

18357,m112,15884,You ready?,ERICA,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18358,m112,15884,For what?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18359,m112,15884,You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.,ERICA,knight moves,mystery,optimism

18362,m112,15885,It isn't Kathy.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18363,m112,15885,Who's Kathy?,ERICA,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18364,m112,15886,Whaddaya got Nolan?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18365,m112,15886,Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18366,m112,15886,How long has she been dead?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18367,m112,15886,Six eight hours tops.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18368,m112,15886,Any sign of rape?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18369,m112,15886,Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,anger
18370,m112,15887,There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,joy
18371,m112,15887,Bingo.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18372,m112,15888,Anything?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18373,m112,15888,Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18374,m112,15888,What about prints?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18375,m112,15888,No prints.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18376,m112,15888,You mean no prints but hers?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18377,m112,15888,No Frank.  No prints.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18378,m112,15889,He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18379,m112,15889,There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18380,m112,15889,Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18381,m112,15890,This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18382,m112,15890,That's great.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18383,m112,15890,Wait I've saved the best for last. Andy hit the lights will you?,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,anger
18384,m112,15891,Same as the others?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18385,m112,15891,Yeah.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18386,m112,15891,How long she been dead?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18387,m112,15891,I'd say at least eighteen hours.,NOLAN,knight moves,mystery,anger
18388,m112,15891,That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18389,m112,15892,Well?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18390,m112,15892,Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18391,m112,15892,You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18392,m112,15892,I'm a psychologist Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18393,m112,15892,What did Dr. Fulton tell you?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18394,m112,15893,Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18395,m112,15893,We're not sure.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18396,m112,15893,What do you think he did?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18397,m112,15893,We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18398,m112,15894,I'm busy right now.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18399,m112,15894,It's important.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18400,m112,15895,I see you're still having problems with your openings.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18401,m112,15895,And this Jeremy--,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18402,m112,15895,--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82 didn't you?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18403,m112,15896,No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18404,m112,15896,But we heard him.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18405,m112,15896,It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18406,m112,15897,Kathy?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18407,m112,15897,Well the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18408,m112,15897,What about the way he arranged the body?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18409,m112,15898,That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But in all the research I've read on Serial Killers I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18410,m112,15898,Anything else?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18411,m112,15898,Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18412,m112,15898,I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18413,m112,15898,I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18414,m112,15899,I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before Debi Rutlege was found in the center.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18415,m112,15899,Meaning?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18416,m112,15900,His home would be... Mount Olympus.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18417,m112,15900,Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,joy
18418,m112,15901,Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,joy
18419,m112,15901,I know that.  I've seen the photo's.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18420,m112,15901,This ain't no photo.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18421,m112,15902,You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18422,m112,15902,Peter's right Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18423,m112,15903,Well I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels the more chances he'll take.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18424,m112,15903,What did he mean by Huxley?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18425,m112,15904,Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18426,m112,15904,I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18427,m112,15904,It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18428,m112,15904,He moves around a lot.  Why?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18429,m112,15905,Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18430,m112,15905,That's a big area to cover.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18431,m112,15906,As large as castles.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18432,m112,15906,Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18433,m112,15907,What time did he get there?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18434,m112,15907,About a quarter to one.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18435,m112,15908,He's right Kathy.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18436,m112,15908,What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18437,m112,15909,We can't rely on your judgement anymore.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,joy
18438,m112,15909,What does that mean?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18439,m112,15910,And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18440,m112,15910,We're going to work on the message.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18441,m112,15910,This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18442,m112,15910,The most logical choice.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18443,m112,15910,You don't have a shred of evidence!,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18444,m112,15911,Did you see his face?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18445,m112,15911,No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18446,m112,15911,I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,joy
18447,m112,15911,I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18448,m112,15911,Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18449,m112,15912,If you can think of anything else give us a call.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18450,m112,15912,You know I hate to say I told you so but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.,GIRL,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18451,m112,15913,Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18452,m112,15913,Ten days ago.,GIRL,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18453,m112,15913,Do you know how she found the apartment?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18454,m112,15913,Through a rental agency.,GIRL,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18455,m112,15913,Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18456,m112,15914,I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18457,m112,15914,Only in passing.  To say hello to.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18458,m112,15915,Could you tell me where you were last night?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18459,m112,15915,Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18460,m112,15915,I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,joy
18461,m112,15915,To my room and then I went for a walk.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18462,m112,15916,This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger
18463,m112,15916,She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18464,m112,15916,What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18465,m112,15916,I got it from the tournament directory.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18466,m112,15917,Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,joy
18467,m112,15917,I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18468,m112,15918,Mister Sanderson this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.,FRANK,knight moves,mystery,anger

18584,m112,15951,Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18585,m112,15951,We need your help.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18586,m112,15951,I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18587,m112,15951,But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18588,m112,15951,I can't right now.  I've got a game.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18589,m112,15951,She could be dead after the game.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18590,m112,15951,She could be dead now.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18591,m112,15951,What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18592,m112,15952,You sure you don't want to eat something?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18593,m112,15952,I don't think I could.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18594,m112,15953,It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18595,m112,15953,You sound like my mother.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18596,m112,15953,It wasn't intentional.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18597,m112,15953,Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18598,m112,15954,I think it's interesting.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18599,m112,15954,Another kind of game?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18600,m112,15954,In a way.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18601,m112,15954,This isn't a game.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18602,m112,15954,Oh but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18603,m112,15954,How can you look at it so clinically?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18604,m112,15954,Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18605,m112,15954,That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18606,m112,15954,What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18607,m112,15954,Of course.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18608,m112,15955,I'm just curious.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18609,m112,15955,I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18610,m112,15955,You mean like in the steam room?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18611,m112,15955,That's not fair!,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18612,m112,15955,Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18613,m112,15956,You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18614,m112,15956,Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18615,m112,15957,You have to win every point don't you?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18616,m112,15957,I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18617,m112,15957,Of course.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18618,m112,15957,Why?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18619,m112,15957,Because I work with them.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18620,m112,15958,No.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18621,m112,15958,You're not?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18622,m112,15958,No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18623,m112,15959,Relax.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18624,m112,15959,How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18625,m112,15959,I know it was bad.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18626,m112,15959,How could you?  Unless you were there.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18627,m112,15960,I know you didn't,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18628,m112,15960,You know Andy thinks you're doing this.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18629,m112,15960,Doesn't that scare you?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18630,m112,15960,No.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18631,m112,15960,Why?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18632,m112,15960,Because I think he's wrong.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18633,m112,15961,Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18634,m112,15961,No.  But I'm open to distractions.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18635,m112,15961,I'm sure you are.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18636,m112,15962,You know you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18637,m112,15962,You always want to talk about me.  What about you?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18638,m112,15962,Wasn't I just talking about me?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18639,m112,15962,No.  You were talking about chess.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18640,m112,15962,Alright.  What about me?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18641,m112,15962,I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18642,m112,15962,She died in a car accident.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18643,m112,15962,I'm sorry.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18644,m112,15962,It's alright.  It was a long time ago.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18645,m112,15962,It must've been very hard on Erica?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18646,m112,15963,What?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18647,m112,15963,Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18648,m112,15963,I'm not playing a game now.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18649,m112,15963,Yes you are.  You're playing word games.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18650,m112,15963,What is this?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18651,m112,15963,I'm just trying to get to know you Peter.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18652,m112,15963,What?  By attacking me?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18653,m112,15964,Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18654,m112,15964,What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18655,m112,15964,Does anyone?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18656,m112,15965,I just don't want to fight with you.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18657,m112,15965,Then show me who you are.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18658,m112,15966,This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18659,m112,15966,You've got to face the things you feel.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18660,m112,15966,I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18661,m112,15966,I said I didn't plan on getting involved.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18662,m112,15967,You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game is it?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18663,m112,15967,No.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18664,m112,15968,I'm hungry.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18665,m112,15968,Call room service.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18666,m112,15969,Fine.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18667,m112,15969,What do you want on it?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18668,m112,15969,You.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18669,m112,15969,Would you settle for pepperoni?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18670,m112,15969,If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18671,m112,15970,Did you call?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18672,m112,15970,The line was busy.  I'll try again.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18673,m112,15971,They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18674,m112,15971,I thought you said the line was busy?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18675,m112,15971,I tried again and got through.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18676,m112,15971,What's wrong?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18677,m112,15971,Nothing.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18678,m112,15971,Then why are you backing up?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18679,m112,15972,Peter you have to admit--,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18680,m112,15972,--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18681,m112,15973,Peter...,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18682,m112,15973,How could you think that Kathy?  How could you even consider it?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18683,m112,15974,In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18684,m112,15974,For emphasis?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18685,m112,15974,Exactly.  It's the key.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18686,m112,15974,But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18687,m112,15974,A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18688,m112,15974,What?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18689,m112,15974,Where's the note?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18690,m112,15975,He's replaying the game I played against him move by move using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18691,m112,15975,Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18692,m112,15975,Right.  Here!  c-4.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18693,m112,15976,Hi.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18694,m112,15976,Can I come in?,PETER,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18695,m112,15977,The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18696,m112,15977,I'm not looking for an apology Peter.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18697,m112,15977,I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18698,m112,15977,I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18699,m112,15977,You really haven't seen my best side.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18700,m112,15978,Peter...,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18701,m112,15978,No listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,joy
18702,m112,15978,That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18703,m112,15978,I can't think any more unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18704,m112,15978,You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,joy
18705,m112,15978,You don't understand.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness

18707,m112,15978,It's not that easy.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18708,m112,15978,Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18709,m112,15978,But I do.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18710,m112,15979,This letter.  I've never opened it.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,sadness
18711,m112,15979,Why not?,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,optimism
18712,m112,15979,Because I know what it says.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18713,m112,15979,Maybe you're afraid of what it says.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18714,m112,15980,If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger
18715,m112,15980,It could be anything.,KATHY,knight moves,mystery,anger
18716,m112,15980,It's got to be grammatically correct.,PETER,knight moves,mystery,anger

18810,m113,16007,We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,anger
18811,m113,16007,I have lived in this place like my fathers before me guarding the old knowledge. I knew when I had no son that the Great War would come in my time and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,anger
18812,m113,16008,This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before a thousand years ago. A young king and queen with extraordinary powers were given to us then to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor as I will be yours.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,joy
18813,m113,16008,I have no extraordinary powers.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,anger
18814,m113,16008,Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?,YNYR,krull,fantasy,anger
18815,m113,16008,In the old books. It's called a glaive.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,optimism

18819,m113,16009,But there is another entrance to this place.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,anger
18820,m113,16010,But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,anger

18827,m113,16012,You must break when the strain becomes too great or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?,YNYR,krull,fantasy,anger
18828,m113,16012,She was in a great fortress first in the mountains then in the jungle. How is that possible?,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,anger
18829,m113,16012,It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer at all costs.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,joy
18830,m113,16012,The Fortress moves?,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,optimism
18831,m113,16012,Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains sometimes in the jungle sometimes the desert sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,anger
18832,m113,16012,Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is we'll never be able to reach her for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,sadness
18833,m113,16012,No. They occupy the Fortress but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And sooner or later Fate will place it near us.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,anger
18834,m113,16012,Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men and brave. They will help us.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,anger
18835,m113,16012,You have not slept in two days.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,sadness

18840,m113,16014,Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,sadness
18841,m113,16015,I can't reach her.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,sadness
18842,m113,16015,What do you see?,YNYR,krull,fantasy,optimism
18843,m113,16015,Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,sadness
18844,m113,16016,She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,sadness
18845,m113,16016,Yes they knew of your first contact so they drove her below.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,joy
18846,m113,16016,She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,sadness
18847,m113,16016,The deeper she goes the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level you will not be able to reach her at all.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,joy
18848,m113,16016,I will find her!,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,anger
18849,m113,16017,I cannot reach her.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,sadness
18850,m113,16017,She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex the place of The Beast.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,sadness
18851,m113,16018,The first time when they attacked long ago was The Beast here?,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,joy
18852,m113,16018,No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time from the ferocity of their onslaught from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,joy
18853,m113,16018,<u>Why</u>?,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,sadness
18854,m113,16018,I'm not sure.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,sadness
18855,m113,16018,But you suspect.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,sadness
18856,m113,16018,You will know in good time.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,anger
18857,m113,16019,No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,anger

18866,m113,16019,You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power and you forget the pain of long waiting.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,sadness

18872,m113,16022,You will tell me her name and we will go together.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,anger
18873,m113,16022,You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,joy
18874,m113,16023,He ran a great risk helping us today. If he opposes his fate his death will be terribly painful.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,sadness
18875,m113,16023,Let us wish him peace.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,anger
18876,m113,16024,They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex the place of the Beast where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...,YNYR,krull,fantasy,anger
18877,m113,16024,The Beast will kill her.,COLWYN,krull,fantasy,joy
18878,m113,16024,Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress you will be able to contact her.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,anger
18879,m113,16025,She must make a glaive.,YNYR,krull,fantasy,optimism

20549,m124,17601,You've no idea sir how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20550,m124,17602,Where is your mad pilot?,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20551,m124,17602,He must have had a heart attack or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20552,m124,17603,You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far but quite difficult.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger

20554,m124,17604,And the wine - excellent.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20555,m124,17604,I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20556,m124,17605,It's three thousand feet practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,optimism

20562,m124,17605,In time you will meet them all.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20563,m124,17606,For a man who talks a great deal it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20564,m124,17606,There are some things my dear Conway I deeply regret I may not discuss.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20565,m124,17606,You know that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20566,m124,17606,Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20567,m124,17607,By the way what religion do you follow here?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20568,m124,17607,We follow many.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20569,m124,17608,To put it simply I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind even including  the excess of virtue itself.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20570,m124,17608,That's intelligent.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20571,m124,17608,We find in the Valley it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20572,m124,17608,How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20573,m124,17608,Oh good heavens no!,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20574,m124,17608,How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20575,m124,17608,Why we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack usually. Avariciousness envy the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20576,m124,17608,You have no disputes over women?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20577,m124,17608,Only very rarely. You see it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20578,m124,17608,Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20579,m124,17609,But Mr. Chang all these things - books instruments sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20580,m124,17609,They were.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20581,m124,17609,Well it must have taken,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20582,m124,17609,Centuries.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20583,m124,17609,Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20584,m124,17609,Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because well because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20585,m124,17610,That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20586,m124,17610,Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20587,m124,17610,buy and sell?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20588,m124,17610,Buy and - sell? No no pardon me exchange .,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20589,m124,17610,I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20590,m124,17610,That my dear Conway is the story of a remarkable man.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20591,m124,17610,Who?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20592,m124,17610,A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault the first European to find this place and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La taught our natives and began our collection of art. In fact Shangri-La is Father Perrault.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20593,m124,17610,When was all this?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20594,m124,17610,Oh let me see - way back in 1713 I think it was that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that one leg being frozen and of course there being no doctors here he amputated the leg himself.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20595,m124,17611,One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20596,m124,17611,The only one.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20597,m124,17611,And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20598,m124,17611,The High Lama arranges everything Mr. Conway.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20599,m124,17611,Well then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,anger

20604,m124,17613,Yes charming.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20605,m124,17613,Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20606,m124,17613,Why not? She's an attractive young woman.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20607,m124,17613,Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20608,m124,17613,Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20609,m124,17613,Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20610,m124,17613,Suppose she should leave it?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20611,m124,17613,Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20612,m124,17613,No I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20613,m124,17614,You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.,CHANG,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20614,m124,17614,I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness

20670,m124,17628,Are you taking me?,MARIA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20671,m124,17628,Yes of course. Certainly. Come on!,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism

20676,m124,17630,Yes.,HIGH LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20677,m124,17631,I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La since your arrival.,HIGH LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20678,m124,17631,Personally I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20679,m124,17632,It's astonishing - and incredible but,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20680,m124,17632,What is it my son?,HIGH LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20681,m124,17632,You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive Father Perrault!,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20682,m124,17632,Sit down my son.  You may not know it but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.,HIGH LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20683,m124,17633,That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.,HIGH LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20684,m124,17633,That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20685,m124,17633,Sondra Bizet.,HIGH LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20686,m124,17633,Oh the girl at the piano?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20687,m124,17633,Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you as have we all.,HIGH LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20688,m124,17633,Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that for the moment doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20689,m124,17633,We need men like you here to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still by the world's standards a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here however in Shangri- La by our standards your life has just begun and may go on and on.,HIGH LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20690,m124,17633,But to be candid Father a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so then long life must be even more pointless. No I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20691,m124,17633,We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision long long ago. I saw all the nations strengthening not in wisdom but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man exulting in the technique of murder would rage so hotly over the world that every book every treasure would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is what blindness what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come my friend when this orgy will spend itself when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here and why you were brought here. For when that day comes the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes my son when the strong have devoured each other the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled and the meek shall inherit the earth.,HIGH LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20692,m124,17634,Yes of course your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.,LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20693,m124,17634,I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20694,m124,17634,You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem Conway.,LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20695,m124,17634,Mine?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20696,m124,17634,Because my son I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.,LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20697,m124,17635,I have waited for you my son for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend it is not an arduous task that I bequeath for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient to care for the riches of the mind to preside in wisdom while the storm rages without.,LAMA,lost horizon,adventure,anger

20714,m124,17642,You?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20715,m124,17642,Just this once Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are.

20720,m124,17644,Yes Bob.,GEORGE,lost horizon,adventure,optimism

20723,m124,17644,Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No you wouldn't say that. They don't count.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,joy
20724,m124,17644,You'd better try to get some sleep Bob.,GEORGE,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20725,m124,17644,"Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me Freshie with all those other shrewd little Foreign Secretaries?  You see the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing and if you can't get it with smooth talk you send an army in. I'm going to fool them Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say """"Come in gentlemen - what can we do for you?""""  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think Freshie? They'll think to themselves - """"Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly and why should we shoot them?"""" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is?

20765,m124,17654,George I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there?

20788,m124,17662,I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn.

I can't believe it Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them.

20895,m124,17688,Thank you.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20896,m124,17688,Well I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.,SONDRA,lost horizon,adventure,sadness

20905,m124,17690,On the contrary you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before that I belong here.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20906,m124,17690,I'm so glad.,SONDRA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20907,m124,17690,I can't quite explain it but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see these cherry blossoms you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime a great crime yet I accept it amiably with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20908,m124,17690,Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.,SONDRA,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20909,m124,17690,I wonder.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20910,m124,17690,I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security where there's beauty and comfort where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.,SONDRA,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20911,m124,17690,Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness

20918,m124,17692,Goodness no. From what you tell me about it it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.,SONDRA,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20919,m124,17692,It's not so bad really. Some phases are a little sordid of course. That's only to be expected.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20920,m124,17692,Why?,SONDRA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism
20921,m124,17692,Oh the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20922,m124,17692,Struggling why?,SONDRA,lost horizon,adventure,sadness
20923,m124,17692,Well everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself accumulate a nest egg and so on.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,anger
20924,m124,17692,Why?,SONDRA,lost horizon,adventure,optimism

20929,m124,17694,Forgiven.  You know when we were on that plane I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills leaping rivers crashing over obstacles never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.,CONWAY,lost horizon,adventure,optimism

21640,m138,19558,I see.  How much?,MARIAN,my mother dreams the satan's disciples in new york,short,optimism
21641,m138,19558,Forty-five all total.,MISCHA,my mother dreams the satan's disciples in new york,short,optimism

21643,m138,19558,Thirty is base price.  Tolls tax tip ... it all adds up.,MISCHA,my mother dreams the satan's disciples in new york,short,optimism
21644,m144,20456,It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy that one government should assume a right to dictate to another who is upon terms of equality the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and assuming such a right second it by threatening language in case of non-compliance.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,joy
21645,m144,20456,But Your Majesty the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade boycott English goods suspend all commercial dealings with her and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.,CAULAINCOURT,napoleon,family,joy
21646,m144,20456,My dear Caulaincourt agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but before that he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,joy
21647,m144,20456,I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.,CAULAINCOURT,napoleon,family,joy
21648,m144,20456,It's a fine thing to establish policies but when they don't work they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain alone would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent for her armies.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,joy
21649,m144,20456,I am in no position to debate this with you Your Majesty but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.,CAULAINCOURT,napoleon,family,joy
21650,m144,20456,My dear Caulaincourt you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland by the nobility for ruining their trade with England by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,joy
21651,m144,20457,Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you and in my responsibility to the Emperor if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.,CAULAINCOURT,napoleon,family,joy
21652,m144,20457,I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war and I presume that is what you are alluding to I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,joy
21653,m144,20458,I hope you will forgive me Your Majesty for requesting an audience at such a late hour but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you on a matter which cannot wait.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,anger
21654,m144,20458,Very well General what is it you wish to say?,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,anger
21655,m144,20458,Your Majesty I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon offering a peace treaty and that you have decided to accept it.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,anger
21656,m144,20458,I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,anger
21657,m144,20458,If I may Your Majesty I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,anger
21658,m144,20458,General Kutusov feel free to say whatever you like.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,optimism
21659,m144,20458,I believe I am right in saying that before the fire the country had grown weary of the war and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,anger
21660,m144,20458,Proceed.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,optimism
21661,m144,20458,But since the fire a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals against whom Russia must be avenged against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,joy
21662,m144,20458,You know General Kutusov there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,anger
21663,m144,20459,Well that is a very interesting idea General Kutusov but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,anger
21664,m144,20459,I have no doubt that he has Your Majesty but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,anger
21665,m144,20459,Well one thing immediately comes to mind if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,anger
21666,m144,20459,Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,joy
21667,m144,20459,I must confess he would look a bit silly fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,optimism
21668,m144,20459,Perhaps it would be even more serious than that Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him at the first sign of weakness.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,anger
21669,m144,20459,Proceed.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,optimism
21670,m144,20459,If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow there is nothing and that if he withdraws there remains only a fall into emptiness.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,joy
21671,m144,20460,What do you think Napoleon will do?,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,anger
21672,m144,20460,I personally am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement by Your Majesty he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,anger
21673,m144,20461,If he withdraws his army in good order it will be a serious political defeat.  But if he should be caught on the move with his army in the full grip of winter then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence be deceit by any means for another month thus postponing his departure then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,joy
21674,m144,20461,General Kutusov I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,anger
21675,m144,20461,I am at your disposal Your Majesty.,GENERAL KUTUSOV,napoleon,family,optimism
21676,m144,20462,And what a great pleasure it is indeed to meet you Alexander.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21677,m144,20462,And what a delightful idea!,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,optimism
21678,m144,20462,Ah -- you approve?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21679,m144,20462,I think it's absolutely charming.,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,optimism
21680,m144,20462,I'm glad you like it.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21681,m144,20462,Whatever suggested the idea to you?,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,optimism
21682,m144,20462,I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy I had a passion for rafts and never had the opportunity to build one.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21683,m144,20463,You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry they merely trudge along head down.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21684,m144,20463,Fascinating!  Tell me leaving aside the question of grand strategy for the moment what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?,ALEXANDER,napoleon,family,optimism
21685,m144,20463,"Without a doubt to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50000 preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25000 about to withdraw. """"Berthier sees only what is in the open Murat said.  But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest.""""

21863,m144,20496,Are you staying with a friend sir?,GIRL,napoleon,family,optimism
21864,m144,20496,No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21865,m144,20496,Is it a nice warm room sir?,GIRL,napoleon,family,optimism
21866,m144,20497,Br-rrr these sheets are like ice.,GIRL,napoleon,family,sadness
21867,m144,20497,Oh I'm sorry about that.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21868,m144,20498,What's your name?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21869,m144,20498,Lisette.,GIRL,napoleon,family,sadness
21870,m144,20498,Only Lisette?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21871,m144,20498,Lisette La Croix.,GIRL,napoleon,family,optimism
21872,m144,20498,That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21873,m144,20498,Please sir come into bed or I shall die of a chill.,GIRL,napoleon,family,sadness
21874,m144,20498,Oh yes... of course.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21875,m144,20499,I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21876,m144,20499,To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know Citizen General that your wife has taken a lover one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,joy
21877,m144,20500,Naturally one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but on the other hand it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think Joseph?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21878,m144,20500,No...,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,sadness
21879,m144,20500,Junot?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21880,m144,20501,No... nothing at all.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,sadness
21881,m144,20501,Not even the slightest hint of something?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21882,m144,20501,No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,sadness
21883,m144,20501,You would tell me Joseph wouldn't you?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21884,m144,20501,Yes of course I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers but I certainly know nothing about this.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,joy
21885,m144,20501,And you Junot?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21886,m144,20502,The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely in the courts.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21887,m144,20502,You know I am only too happy to be of help to you but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,sadness
21888,m144,20502,I know of no better time.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21889,m144,20502,You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,joy
21890,m144,20502,The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21891,m144,20502,You must not act impetuously.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,joy
21892,m144,20502,It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21893,m144,20502,But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,anger
21894,m144,20502,My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again I might be tempted to strangle her.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21895,m144,20503,Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,sadness
21896,m144,20503,Are you trying to insult me?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21897,m144,20503,Of course not but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,joy
21898,m144,20503,Well you shall see.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21899,m144,20503,When is she supposed to return?,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,sadness
21900,m144,20503,I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home she will find her things in the street and my door locked.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21901,m144,20503,She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,joy
21902,m144,20503,My dear Joseph the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress he does not want her for his wife.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21903,m144,20504,Will you use the troops?,JOSEPH,napoleon,family,joy
21904,m144,20504,Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21905,m144,20505,Ah my dear Madame de Montesquiou you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21906,m144,20505,I am delighted to be of service to you again Your Highness.  And I can tell you my instructions came directly from the Emperor with a caution to be discreet.,MONTESQUIOU,napoleon,family,optimism
21907,m144,20505,Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21908,m144,20505,I rarely see him Your Highness but I believe he is in excellent health and he is very happy with the child.,MONTESQUIOU,napoleon,family,optimism
21909,m144,20505,Ah that is good.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21910,m144,20505,And you seem in excellent health Your Highness.,MONTESQUIOU,napoleon,family,anger
21911,m144,20505,Ah well my dear Madame de Montesquiou peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21912,m144,20506,Ah how nice to meet you General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21913,m144,20506,Thank you Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago at a party at Paul's house.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21914,m144,20506,Oh... yes of course!  Have you met my daughter Hortense?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21915,m144,20506,Yes we introduced ourselves at the door.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21916,m144,20506,May I offer you a drink?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21917,m144,20506,Oh I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21918,m144,20506,Oh it's not the slightest inconvenience General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21919,m144,20506,You are very kind Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry perhaps?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21920,m144,20506,Yes of course.  Hortense darling will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21921,m144,20507,I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21922,m144,20507,Yes I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21923,m144,20507,Well I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21924,m144,20508,Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21925,m144,20508,No I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21926,m144,20508,Oh you must forgive me General Bonaparte I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more and he has so many things in his room I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,joy
21927,m144,20509,Were you in love with him?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21928,m144,20509,I thought I was.  I was confused.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21929,m144,20509,And now?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21930,m144,20509,Now I know that I shall die if you leave me.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21931,m144,20509,Do you expect me to believe that?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21932,m144,20509,Yes.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21933,m144,20510,And you are you in love with any one else?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21934,m144,20510,No.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21935,m144,20510,But you have had mistresses while you were away.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21936,m144,20510,Of course.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21937,m144,20510,Were you in love with any of them?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21938,m144,20510,No.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21939,m144,20510,Were they pretty?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21940,m144,20510,Yes.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21941,m144,20510,Were any of them prettier than I am?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21942,m144,20510,One had better legs.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21943,m144,20511,Promise me you will never leave me.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21944,m144,20511,I cannot promise you that.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21945,m144,20511,Promise me.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21946,m144,20511,I will never forgive you.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21947,m144,20511,I don't care but promise you will never leave me.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21948,m144,20511,I don't understand you.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21949,m144,20511,Promise.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21950,m144,20511,Promises mean nothing.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21951,m144,20511,Perhaps -- but tell me you promise anyway.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21952,m144,20511,All right -- I promise.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21953,m144,20512,Yes -- what is it?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21954,m144,20512,Open the door.  It's me.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21955,m144,20512,Go away -- I'm busy.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21956,m144,20512,I know what you're doing in there.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,anger
21957,m144,20512,Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21958,m144,20512,Where is Madame Trillaud?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21959,m144,20512,How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21960,m144,20512,What are you doing in there?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21961,m144,20512,Oh -- now this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests you will return to the table at once.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21962,m144,20512,Will you be joining us soon?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21963,m144,20513,Separate bedrooms?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21964,m144,20513,Yes.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21965,m144,20513,But you will not... be safe...,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21966,m144,20513,Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21967,m144,20513,In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21968,m144,20514,Who is it?,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21969,m144,20514,It's me.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21970,m144,20515,I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21971,m144,20515,Oh my darling.  I'm sorry too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment I promise.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,sadness
21972,m144,20516,Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently he sent Madame Le Floch there last year and she gave birth to twins.,JOSEPHINE,napoleon,family,optimism
21973,m144,20516,Indeed -- well you may tell Dr. Corvisart I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21974,m144,20517,No one cannot simply ignore it.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,anger
21975,m144,20517,I am afraid then I have to ask you both Joseph as my brother and Junot as my good friend whether or not you know anything about this or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21976,m144,20518,I believe you sent for me.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,anger
21977,m144,20518,Yes yes please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21978,m144,20519,God damn it Junot wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21979,m144,20519,There's probably some explanation.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,anger
21980,m144,20519,Yes I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21981,m144,20520,Well anyway sorry to call you away from the festivities but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21982,m144,20520,I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
21983,m144,20520,Why did you give it to him?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21984,m144,20520,I thought he would be seeing you before I would and would give it to you.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,anger
21985,m144,20520,Well he didn't give it to me and when I ask you to do something for me return the work to me not to Berthier.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21986,m144,20520,I'm sorry I thought he would give it to you.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,sadness
21987,m144,20520,I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
21988,m144,20520,He's downstairs -- somewhere.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,sadness
21989,m144,20520,All right thank you.  Please ask him to come here.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
21990,m144,20521,Yes... but first can I say something to you as a friend?,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
21991,m144,20521,Certainly.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21992,m144,20521,I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,joy
21993,m144,20521,Why not?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
21994,m144,20521,Well maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,anger
21995,m144,20521,What are you talking about?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21996,m144,20521,Nothing.  That's all I can say.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,joy
21997,m144,20521,That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
21998,m144,20521,That's all I can say.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,anger
21999,m144,20521,Now just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
22000,m144,20522,Look Junot you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
22001,m144,20522,There are some things... better left unsaid.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,anger
22002,m144,20522,You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
22003,m144,20523,What the hell is the matter with you?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
22004,m144,20523,I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,joy
22005,m144,20523,Well whatever the hell you wanted to do you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,joy
22006,m144,20523,You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
22007,m144,20523,Yes.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22008,m144,20523,I wrote it.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
22009,m144,20523,What?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22010,m144,20523,Yes I wrote it.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
22011,m144,20523,You wrote it.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22012,m144,20523,I couldn't face telling you.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,sadness
22013,m144,20524,I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
22014,m144,20524,Yes?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22015,m144,20525,You could hear them?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,sadness
22016,m144,20525,Yes.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
22017,m144,20526,You mean you heard them making love?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22018,m144,20526,Yes.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
22019,m144,20527,How did you know it was Captain Charles?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22020,m144,20527,I questioned the maid and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
22021,m144,20527,Can you give me a drink please?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22022,m144,20527,Yes of course.  What do you want?,JUNOT,napoleon,family,optimism
22023,m144,20528,I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,anger
22024,m144,20528,And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,anger
22025,m144,20528,I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet in Paris.,JUNOT,napoleon,family,sadness
22026,m144,20529,Good day monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?,MAJOR FIDON,napoleon,family,anger
22027,m144,20529,My regrets my dear Major but I believe you have been blocking the road.,RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN,napoleon,family,sadness
22028,m144,20529,Are you trying to provoke me monsieur?,MAJOR FIDON,napoleon,family,joy
22029,m144,20529,No Major I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine and point out that if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road I could pass you and be on my way.,RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN,napoleon,family,anger
22030,m144,20529,May I inform you monsieur that I am Major Fidon official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and in accordance with the rules of the road no one may overtake or pass me.,MAJOR FIDON,napoleon,family,anger
22031,m144,20529,Before you quote the rules of the road to me Major may I point out to you that you are not in France now but that you are a guest in Russia.,RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN,napoleon,family,optimism
22032,m144,20529,If I have given you any cause to be insulted monsieur may I offer you immediate satisfaction?,MAJOR FIDON,napoleon,family,joy
22033,m144,20529,If you wish to put things on that basis then I will say good day to you monsieur.,RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN,napoleon,family,optimism
22034,m144,20530,Good evening ladies.  You must forgive me my dearest wife but I simply could not wait to see you.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22035,m144,20530,Oh then you are...,MARIE-LOUISE,napoleon,family,optimism
22036,m144,20530,Yes my dearest Marie-Louise I am your husband.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22037,m144,20531,And where did you see my portrait?,MARIE-LOUISE,napoleon,family,sadness
22038,m144,20531,Ah you must forgive me my dearest Marie-Louise I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism
22039,m144,20532,And you my dear wife do you find that I resemble my portraits?,NAPOLEON,napoleon,family,optimism

22569,m181,25640,Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.,ELAINE,simone,short,anger
22570,m181,25640,Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.,VIKTOR,simone,short,optimism

22628,m181,25655,This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?,ELAINE,simone,short,joy
22629,m181,25655,I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.,VIKTOR,simone,short,anger
22630,m181,25655,That's sweet Viktor but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but for some reason I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.,ELAINE,simone,short,joy
22631,m181,25655,No there isn't.  There's nothing to her.,VIKTOR,simone,short,sadness
22632,m181,25655,Oh Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here alone like this.  But in the morning you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?,ELAINE,simone,short,sadness
22633,m181,25655,No I will end my relationship with her -- totally.,VIKTOR,simone,short,joy

22636,m181,25655,Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.,ELAINE,simone,short,anger
22637,m181,25655,Not if I don't let her.,VIKTOR,simone,short,sadness
22638,m181,25656,I'm going to tell you a secret now Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.,VIKTOR,simone,short,optimism
22639,m181,25656,Every actor is an invention Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it but it's not the finder who sparkles.,ELAINE,simone,short,anger
22640,m181,25656,-- No no I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --,VIKTOR,simone,short,sadness
22641,m181,25656,-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.,ELAINE,simone,short,sadness
22642,m181,25656,Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me Elaine.  Simone is thin air pixels molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --,VIKTOR,simone,short,anger

22644,m181,25656,-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I Viktor Taransky have perpetrated the greatest hoax the greatest sleight-of-hand sleight-of-mouth sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me recognizes what I've done -- even you.,VIKTOR,simone,short,joy
22645,m181,25656,You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?,ELAINE,simone,short,joy
22646,m181,25656,No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen nights without end and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!,VIKTOR,simone,short,joy
22647,m181,25657,Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?,VIKTOR,simone,short,optimism

22664,m181,25662,Sometimes.  But just when I think your father's changing for the better I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.,ELAINE,simone,short,sadness

22675,m181,25666,I know it's embarrassing to admit it mom but when I think about it -- honestly I haven't.  I mean it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized going back through my diary they were all TV appearances near misses at parties second-hand rumor gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close touched her been in her physical presence.  Have you?,LAINEY,simone,short,sadness
22676,m181,25666,Well I --,ELAINE,simone,short,optimism

They are our employers after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class Dr. Hartdegen.,DEAN FULTON,the time machine,sci-fi,optimism
23504,m214,30135,I see.,ALEXANDER,the time machine,sci-fi,sadness
23505,m214,30135,"As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is """"Applied Mathematics and Engineering"""" am I correct?""",DEAN FULTON,the time machine,sci-fi,optimism
23506,m214,30135,Exactly correct sir.,ALEXANDER,the time machine,sci-fi,anger
23507,m214,30136,Well just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!,DEAN FULTON,the time machine,sci-fi,sadness
23508,m214,30136,Imagine that.,ALEXANDER,the time machine,sci-fi,optimism

23513,m214,30137,Sir that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.,ALEXANDER,the time machine,sci-fi,anger

23839,m227,31984,I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old very old and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,sadness
23840,m227,31984,What's that?,HEATHER,new nightmare,fantasy,optimism
23841,m227,31984,Killing innocence one way or the other.,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,joy

23846,m227,31986,Captured?  How?,HEATHER,new nightmare,fantasy,joy
23847,m227,31986,By storytellers of all things.  Every so often they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,sadness
23848,m227,31987,Like the Genie in the bottle.,HEATHER,new nightmare,fantasy,optimism
23849,m227,31987,Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways the story gets too familiar or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens when the story dies the evil is set free.,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,joy
23850,m227,31988,You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?,HEATHER,new nightmare,fantasy,joy
23851,m227,31988,Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle Heather that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,sadness
23852,m227,31989,If Freddy's loose I mean in your script where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?,HEATHER,new nightmare,fantasy,sadness

23855,m227,31989,Well see he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space too.  So...he's trying to cross over from film into our reality.,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,optimism
23856,m227,31990,Isn't there anyone that can stop him?,HEATHER,new nightmare,fantasy,joy
23857,m227,31990,Interestingly enough in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you Heather.,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,anger
23858,m227,31990,Me?  Why me?,HEATHER,new nightmare,fantasy,sadness

23860,m227,31990,That was Nancy not me!,HEATHER,new nightmare,fantasy,joy
23861,m227,31990,But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,anger

23865,m227,31992,The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,anger
23866,m227,31992,Choice?  What kind of choice?,HEATHER,new nightmare,fantasy,joy
23867,m227,31992,Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.,WES,new nightmare,fantasy,joy

27398,m314,44554,We can just take this pillowcase.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,anger
27399,m314,44555,I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?,JENNIFER,the curse,sci-fi,anger
27400,m314,44555,Why would you want to be a cop?,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy

27405,m314,44557,Man you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin' you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27406,m314,44557,You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27407,m314,44557,You're some catch Lloyd.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27408,m314,44557,Hey you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27409,m314,44558,He was found a few blocks away.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27410,m314,44558,Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27411,m314,44559,I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27412,m314,44559,That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27413,m314,44559,Hell no I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27414,m314,44559,Oh so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27415,m314,44559,No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better I'd think you liked her.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27416,m314,44559,I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27417,m314,44559,Nah man I'm just saying you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27418,m314,44560,Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,anger
27419,m314,44560,I told you she was innocent.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27420,m314,44560,Hey there was a lot of blood.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27421,m314,44560,She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27422,m314,44560,I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27423,m314,44561,Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27424,m314,44561,Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,optimism
27425,m314,44561,Madonna's in Penthouse?,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,optimism
27426,m314,44561,Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits her bush.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,optimism
27427,m314,44561,Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,optimism
27428,m314,44562,What?,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,optimism
27429,m314,44562,And you think I'm sick?,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27430,m314,44563,He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27431,m314,44563,And he was missing an arm.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27432,m314,44564,I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27433,m314,44564,We only live a few blocks apart.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27434,m314,44564,This is more than fishy this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27435,m314,44564,Okay Lloyd you tell me how she killed them.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27436,m314,44565,She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27437,m314,44565,She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27438,m314,44565,Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27439,m314,44565,You take the cake Lloyd. Come on she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27440,m314,44566,Nah East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27441,m314,44566,The park dude was missing an arm.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27442,m314,44566,Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27443,m314,44566,Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away shoot him.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27444,m314,44566,Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27445,m314,44566,She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27446,m314,44567,He means the last that we know of.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,anger
27447,m314,44567,This one walk you home too?,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,optimism
27448,m314,44568,Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27449,m314,44568,One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27450,m314,44569,Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27451,m314,44569,It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27452,m314,44569,It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27453,m314,44569,Like a vampire or some shit?,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,optimism
27454,m314,44570,You think mafia hit?,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27455,m314,44570,Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,sadness
27456,m314,44570,It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27457,m314,44570,Okay Lloyd. First no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27458,m314,44570,And fifth you're dating her.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,sadness

27462,m314,44571,Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,anger
27463,m314,44572,My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27464,m314,44572,What makes her think that?,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27465,m314,44572,She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27466,m314,44573,So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy

27470,m314,44573,What kind of animal?,PETER,the curse,sci-fi,joy
27471,m314,44573,Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?,LLOYD,the curse,sci-fi,joy

29589,m388,53874,Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.,CAVANAUGH,highlander iii: the sorcerer,fantasy,anger
29590,m388,53875,The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.,MCCLEOD,highlander iii: the sorcerer,fantasy,sadness

31540,m447,61446,Just tell me the fucking riddle.,NICK,arcade,sci-fi,joy
31541,m447,61446,Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...,ALBERT,arcade,sci-fi,anger

On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.,ALBERT,arcade,sci-fi,joy

31556,m447,61452,Good question.  See that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul he stops being a threat.,ALBERT,arcade,sci-fi,joy
